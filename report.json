Developed by Mysten Labs, Sui focuses on high throughput, low latency, and a scalable architecture. Its design is optimized for fast and secure transactions, making it well-suited for decentralized applications (dApps) that require both speed and reliability.\n\nBackground of Sui Blockchain\n\nSui is developed with the intent to address two key challenges in the blockchain industry: scalability and usability. As decentralized applications evolve, traditional blockchains face bottlenecks in transaction throughput and high latency. Sui's architecture is specifically designed to overcome these issues through innovative data structures and consensus protocols.\n\nOriginally conceptualized to enable real-world applications with high performance and minimal fees, Sui draws inspiration from earlier blockchains while introducing significant improvements. It uses advanced cryptographic techniques, object-centric data models, and parallel execution to create a robust environment for both developers and end-users.\n\nAlso, Read | Solana Based NFT Marketplace Development: An Extensive Guide\n\nCore Architecture and Consensus Mechanism\n\nObject-Centric Data Model\n\nUnlike traditional blockchain systems that use account-based models, Sui employs an object-centric data model. This model treats every asset as a distinct, mutable object that can be owned, transferred, or modified independently. Such an approach improves scalability by allowing for parallel processing of transactions that affect different objects concurrently.\n\nKey advantages of the object-centric approach include:\n\nParallel Execution: Transactions that affect non-overlapping objects can be processed in parallel, reducing bottlenecks.\n\nFine-Grained State Management: Developers can work with discrete objects, leading to better optimization and resource utilization.\n\nEnhanced Security: Isolated objects reduce the risk of cascading failures, as a fault in one object does not necessarily affect others.\n\nConsensus Protocol\n\nSui's consensus mechanism is designed to be both fast and secure. It utilizes a combination of techniques tailored to handle the object-centric data model efficiently:\n\nByzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT): Sui integrates a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism to ensure that the network remains secure and operational even if some nodes act maliciously or fail.\n\nAsynchronous Processing: To facilitate rapid confirmation of transactions, Sui allows asynchronous processing of independent transactions, thereby improving overall throughput.\n\nScalability through Sharding: Although not sharding in the traditional sense, Sui's architecture allows for horizontal scaling by partitioning the state space into independently manageable objects.\n\nThe consensus mechanism is optimized to resolve conflicts and ensure data consistency, even when multiple transactions interact with the same object. This is achieved through rigorous validation rules and conflict resolution strategies that are built into the protocol.\n\nAlso, Check | Ethereum Distributed Validator Technology | DVT for Staking\n\nKey Features and Innovations\n\nSui distinguishes itself from other blockchains through several innovative features:\n\nHigh Throughput and Low Latency\n\nBy enabling parallel transaction execution and optimizing consensus processes, Sui achieves a significant boost in throughput.

While these features may signal technical sophistication, they rarely drive lasting adoption when pursued in isolation. A blockchain can be orders of magnitude faster than its peers, but without meaningful usage, it's just another meaningless benchmark. Privacy and decentralization matter—but only when they're violated. Most users will choose convenience over ideology, until the next CEX implosion, or until a supposedly private service—perhaps one dealing in sensitive personal affairs—is hacked, making users' digital histories devastatingly public.\nThe personal computer didn't transform society due to sheer processing speed, but through the convergence of hardware, software, interface design, and ecosystem development. Similarly, the internet's power came not from raw bandwidth, but from the interplay of protocols, applications, and clear, enjoyable UX. Persistent adoption tends to follow a different formula: performance that meets application demands, development frameworks that enable innovation, user experiences that remove friction, and economic designs that align incentives. That's a quality stack. Not one thing done ten times better—but a comprehensive, well-rounded approach. Long-term innovation necessitates first-principled long-term thinking, while being flexible and agile. You don't want merely the cheapest or fastest surgeon but a reliable one that can adapt to changes and is ready when it matters most.\nSui (pronounced \"Swee\") is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain developed by Mysten Labs, founded by former Meta engineers who previously developed the Move programming language and Diem blockchain. Rather than staking its identity on one feature, Sui distinguishes itself by integrating scalability, safety, usability, and composability into a unified design. Its object-centric model and parallel execution engine deliver high throughput for demanding applications. The Move programming language enforces stricter safety at the smart contract level. DeepBook, a native CLOB, introduces traditional market structure into DeFi. And with zkLogin and sponsored transactions, Sui strives to make onboarding as seamless as any Web2 experience.\n10x, But No 10x\nIn this fast-moving terrain—accelerated now by AI tools that can prototype and deploy faster than ever—traditional \"moats\" are looking increasingly two-dimensional. A single feature is no longer a lasting defense. We're entering a three-dimensional era of swarm innovation, where AI-powered applications behave like drones—flying over conventional barriers, landing directly where users need them, and quickly reshaping product expectations. Much like how future warfare is predicted to shift from human-centered combat to autonomous drone swarms operating in concert, crypto innovation is evolving toward multilayered, adaptive systems that can outmaneuver static defenses through coordinated, multi-vector approaches. Move fast, or fade into obscurity.\nIn such an environment, even the deepest moat can become irrelevant. Strategic edge no longer comes from holding one strong position, but from navigating across multiple dimensions at once. And while nothing is guaranteed in this space, Sui demonstrates how infrastructure, user experience, economics, and ecosystem coordination evolve in parallel. Their developer-first approach enables faster, more intuitive building experiences that dramatically reduce time-to-market for complex applications. Not by doing one thing 10x better—but by doing many critical things right, simultaneously achieving excellence across multiple fronts—everything, everywhere, all at once.\n‍\n\nAt a Glance\nCore Philosophy and Architecture\nIntroduction\n10x, But No 10x\nAn Architecture for Success\nDesigning Out Errors: The Preventative Power of Move\nEcosystem and Development Focus\nBuilding for Builders\nProjects Driving Innovation: Two Squids, a Walrus, and a Whale Walk into a Bar\nBuilders on Sui: Enabling New Capabilities\nTop Ecosystem Projects\n\nUse Cases and Market Segments\nWell-Suited for Fun and Games\nCeFi-Like DeFi For the Retail and TradiFi\nBabylon and Lombard Join Sui Ecosystem\nUser Experience Innovations\nSui UI: Web2 Experience for Web3\nWallet Infrastructure\nzkLogin: A Key for Seamless Onboarding\nGas Abstraction and Sui Name Service\n\nFoundations and Validation\nLeadership and Institutional Backing\nExecutive Team &amp; Technical Expertise\nInstitutional Capital &amp; Investment Rounds\nBuilding with Institutions: Momentum and Collaboration\n\nOutlook and Positioning\nThe Competitive Landscape\nTokenomics and Community Engagement\nFuture Growth Vectors\nConclusion: More Than the Sum of Its Parts\n\n‍\nAn Architecture for Success\nUnlike traditional blockchains that evolved through incremental improvements to existing designs, Sui was architected from first principles to address the fundamental limitations that have constrained blockchain adoption. This approach is evident in three core architectural choices that together form the foundation of Sui's technical advantage.\nSui's innovative architecture features the Move Language for enhanced security and developer accessibility through its object-oriented design; Parallel Transaction Execution to dramatically increase throughput by processing independent transactions simultaneously; and DAG-Based Consensus (Mysticeti) using a leaderless graph structure for ultra-fast finality and reduced latency. These core elements are complemented by key innovations like MEV Resistance via parallel execution and deterministic ordering to minimize manipulation; DeepBook, a built-in Central Limit Order Book for efficient DeFi liquidity; Sponsored Transactions &amp; Gas Stations enabling applications to cover user gas fees for a seamless experience; an Advanced Scalability approach combining vertical and exploring horizontal scaling; and Kiosk, a decentralized commerce primitive allowing creators to enforce custom policies like royalties on asset trades.\nDesigning Out Errors: The Preventative Power of Move\nAt the heart of Sui's architecture is the Move programming language, purpose-built for blockchain environments where asset safety and ownership are paramount. Created specifically because existing languages were insufficient for the complexities of blockchain programming, Move was developed by a team led by Adeniyi Abiodun, who brought extensive expertise in programming language design from his work at Meta. Move's object-centric model treats digital assets as native objects with built-in ownership rules, fundamentally changing how developers approach smart contract security. Rather than retrofitting security onto inherently vulnerable systems, Move embeds security directly in its language architecture, making common vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and phantom asset creation structurally difficult or impossible to introduce. This isn't merely a developer convenience—it's a foundational shift that reduces the attack surface available to potential exploiters and enables formal verification of critical code paths, allowing developers to mathematically prove the correctness of their contracts.\nComplementing Move's security focus is Sui's parallel transaction execution model, which fundamentally breaks the traditional blockchain paradigm of processing transactions sequentially. By allowing independent transactions to execute simultaneously, Sui achieves throughput levels that were mathematically impossible in traditional blockchain designs. The recent Mysticeti consensus upgrade refined this approach, enabling approximately 400ms finality—less than a quarter of Solana's 2-3 second finality (5-7.5x slower) and dramatically faster than Ethereum's current 15-minute finality time (with plans for \"Single slot finality\"). This parallel execution model consistently achieves 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) in testing environments, with the capability to scale to 400,000 TPS albeit when operating with 50 validator nodes. For applications where transaction confirmation directly impacts user experience, like gaming or financial trading, this performance differential transforms what's possible within the blockchain environment.\nA fundamental innovation in Sui's design lies in its approach to scalability. While many Layer 1 blockchains focus on vertical scaling—maximizing the performance of individual validators—Sui employs horizontal scaling designed for elasticity of both supply and demand. This architectural choice means that increased activity in one application doesn't negatively impact performance or costs for others on the network. As co-founder Adeniyi Abiodun explains, other blockchains often “penalize success” through surge pricing, where a popular game or DeFi app drives up gas fees for everyone. On Sui, one application's success doesn't hurt the entire ecosystem.\" In practice, this means that when a game like Panzerdogs experiences a surge in players, it doesn't cause gas fees to spike across all Sui applications—unlike on Ethereum or increasingly on Solana during periods of high demand. This is not a bolt-on solution but a core architectural advantage that becomes increasingly valuable as the network grows.\nThe synergy between these architectural elements has proven particularly powerful. Move's object-based model integrates seamlessly with Sui's parallel execution, creating a system that's simultaneously more secure and more performant than competitors that excel in only one dimension. This integration is especially powerful for complex applications like games, where asset ownership and real-time interaction must coexist with robust security. The horizontal scaling approach ensures this performance remains consistent even as the network expands, avoiding the degradation that has plagued other high-growth blockchains. Together, these architectural choices don't just solve individual blockchain limitations—they create a foundation capable of supporting the next generation of decentralized applications.\nBuilding for Builders\nA blockchain is ultimately only as valuable as the applications built upon it. Recognizing this, Sui has adopted a developer-first approach as a core design principle, creating an environment where innovation can flourish with reduced friction and enhanced productivity. This strong focus on developers from the outset is yielding results, evident in both quantitative metrics and qualitative developer feedback.\nSui CPO Adeniyi Abiodun emphasizes that \"we started our journey feeling like ultimately we can't just follow the playbook of other chains. We knew if we were really obsessive about the developer experience we'd win - that's really it. So we very much over-indexed on developer experience from day one.\" This developer-centric philosophy has shaped Sui from its inception, with engineers at Mysten Labs committed to \"building the best platform that developers can use on a daily basis and feel really proud about what they develop.\"\nThe vision extends beyond the current Web3 paradigm, as Abiodun explains: \"Our goal is not just web three - our goal is to win over the mass majority of the internet. We're building a decentralized stack for coordinating internet interactions while everyone else is just building chains. We can do chains better than everyone else, but the extra step in building a platform for all developers is an area where I think we could really excel more than anyone else in the market.\" This holistic approach, according to Abiodun, positions Sui as \"the most powerful developer platform for internet 3.0 where every developer now has the ability to offer their products and services in a new decentralized way without having middlemen or brokers in the middle.\"\nThe most immediate advantage for developers comes through Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs), which revolutionize how developers interact with blockchain infrastructure. PTBs allow developers to treat smart contracts effectively as APIs, enabling the construction of complex interactions between multiple assets or contracts using traditional programming languages like Rust or C++. With PTBs, developers can essentially orchestrate sophisticated multi-step transactions without writing intricate smart contracts.\nFor example, a developer could use PTBs to create a game marketplace where players can simultaneously list multiple game items, convert proceeds to stablecoins, and stake a portion—all in a single atomic transaction using familiar programming patterns rather than complex smart contract orchestration. This dramatically reduces development complexity and time: one gaming studio reported completing their marketplace integration in three days instead of the projected three weeks. This efficiency gain isn't marginal—it represents an order of magnitude improvement in development velocity that enables rapid iteration and experimentation.\nPTBs also enable permissionless composability, where developers can build upon existing applications without requiring approval or custom integration. This creates powerful network effects where each new application increases the utility of the entire ecosystem. The ability to seamlessly combine multiple contract interactions not only accelerates development but opens possibilities for entirely new application categories that would be impractically complex to build on traditional blockchain architectures.\nThis developer-friendly approach has catalyzed remarkable ecosystem growth. Core developer participation has grown from just 5 in early 2022 to a peak of 84 in January 2024—a 16.8x increase that outpaces the growth rates of competing Layer 1 protocols at similar developmental stages. The broader developer ecosystem shows even more dramatic expansion, with monthly active developers surging from 13 at launch to a peak of 892, demonstrating strong belief in the platform's long-term viability among those with the technical expertise to evaluate it critically.\nThe strength of Sui's ecosystem is further evidenced by its robust developer and community engagement throughout 2024. The Sui Basecamp 2024 event demonstrated significant global reach, attracting over 1,100 participants from 65 countries and featuring 100 speakers. The Sui Overflow Hackathon drew more than 2,000 participants from over 75 countries and generated 352 project submissions—with 32 winning projects selected—numbers that rival the largest hackathons in the blockchain space. This impressive momentum continued at the Builder House Singapore event, which gathered over 2,400 attendees and featured key ecosystem developments such as the Walrus Whitepaper and the strategic USDC integration announcement.\nProjects Driving Innovation: Two Squids, a Walrus, and a Whale Walk into a Bar\nBeyond the core protocol, Sui's architecture is empowering projects and protocols to build novel solutions that enable entirely new capabilities within the ecosystem.\nBuilders on Sui: Enabling New Capabilities\nInnovative dApps and infrastructure solutions are recognizing Sui's architectural advantages and building experiences made possible only by its unique design. Ika (squid in Japanese) chose Sui for its trustless cross-chain interoperability solution, implementing a novel cryptographic scheme called 2PC-MPC (Two-Party Computation Multi-Party Computation). This approach creates a new primitive called the dWallet, which enables Sui smart contract developers to control assets across multiple blockchains without traditional bridge vulnerabilities. Ika leverages Sui as its coordination layer, where its IKA token and staking mechanisms reside, while using the platform's unique object-centric data model to implement complex functionalities like multi-chain custody and trustless account transfers (sending an entire wallet to another user).\n\nIka: Unlocking parallel MPC breakthroughs through Sui's distinctive architecture.When selecting a blockchain foundation, Ika's technical requirements for latency, throughput, and decentralization eliminated all existing networks except Sui. According to their team, implementing their cryptographic breakthroughs on any other platform \"just wouldn't work\" and would \"completely destroy all of the breakthroughs\" in their fast cryptography implementation. One of the most compelling applications is native Bitcoin programmability on Sui, where users can keep their Bitcoin in a dWallet and enforce logic on it through Sui smart contracts without moving it off the Bitcoin network or creating a derivative. This enables lending and borrowing against native BTC without the added security risks, regulatory complexities, and tax consequences of wrapped Bitcoin—addressing a major capital inefficiency in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Sui's performance enables Ika to achieve sub-second speeds while scaling to 10,000 signatures per second with hundreds of signer nodes—all while maintaining zero-trust security.\nAddressing sophisticated financial needs requires a blockchain capable of supporting complex, secure, and highly performant on-chain logic – a vision that Aeon is pursuing. Aeon is developing an MPC wallet designed for funds, treasuries, and DeFi investors, enabling automated operations, yield optimization, and risk mitigation across more than 30 chains. This platform aims to blend the seamless usability of Web2 platforms with the unparalleled security and decentralized assurances inherent to Web3 infrastructure. Crucially, Aeon's team highlights that achieving this vision is only possible on Sui, leveraging it as a robust coordination layer that provides the essential security, scalability, and flexibility needed for institutional-grade custody solutions.\nSui's distinct computational model and the Move programming language are integral to Aeon's secure infrastructure strategy. Aeon's entire business logic lives on-chain on Sui, supporting complex features like user permissions, transaction voting, and a sophisticated policy engine. This is made possible by features like Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs), which Aeon leverages to chain together over 150 function calls in a single, complex transaction—a feat not easily replicated on traditional EVM networks. Furthermore, Move's unique patterns, such as the hot potato pattern for permissionless chain integrations and the capability pattern for strict access control, provide foundational building blocks essential for Aeon's broad chain support and enhanced security posture. Combined with user-friendly features enabled by Sui like zkLogin and gas sponsoring, these technical capabilities allow Aeon to deliver an institutional-grade, yet intuitive, multi-chain asset management platform that the team believes is uniquely possible on Sui.\nTop Ecosystem Projects\nProminent projects across key verticals are also choosing Sui due to its performance and developer-friendly environment. Among these, Walrus stands out as a decentralized storage and data availability protocol built on Sui, designed to handle large binary files like videos, images, and AI datasets with high efficiency and reliability. Leveraging advanced erasure coding for resilience, Walrus integrates tightly with Sui for coordination and payments, allowing developers to offload unstructured data storage and enabling programmable interactions with stored data. Its economic model includes burning SUI tokens, creating deflationary pressure. Launched in March 2025 with $140 million in backing and a $2 billion fully diluted valuation, Walrus has demonstrated strong performance, processing 5 million blobs (27.85TB) during its testnet phase. It serves as a critical storage layer for Sui's history and dApps, positioning Sui as a key player in decentralized storage for data-intensive applications like AI, gaming, and DeFi by bridging Web2 and Web3 storage paradigms.\nIn decentralized finance, Suilend has quickly emerged as a leading lending protocol on Sui. Built by the team behind Solend, a prominent lending protocol on Solana, Suilend brings proven expertise in DeFi application development to the Sui ecosystem, establishing a robust platform for lending and borrowing activities. Beyond lending protocols like Suilend, Scallop, and Navi, Sui's DeFi landscape is home to other significant protocols such as Cetus for decentralized exchange and Bluefin for perpetuals trading, collectively contributing to a vibrant and comprehensive financial ecosystem.\n\nAxelar, a leading Web3 interoperability platform connecting over 69 blockchains ($10B+ transferred across 2.5M+ transactions), and Squid, a decentralized finance router protocol ($1.5B routed through 900K transactions for 350K users), have also integrated with Sui to enhance its cross-chain capabilities. Axelar brings General Message Passing functionality to Sui, enabling seamless asset transfers and smart contract interactions across chains, while Squid builds on this foundation to facilitate efficient cross-chain token swaps and liquidity in under 20 seconds. In their \"Path Towards an Interoperable Future\" discussion, both protocols highlighted Sui's differentiation from standard EVM chains, Move's well-structured design, and the advantages of Deep Book, Sui's on-chain order book.\nSui's object-centric data model provides another substantial advantage for developers building complex applications. This model offers a natural mapping for concepts like game assets, NFTs, and financial instruments, which are often hierarchical and composable. By aligning the blockchain's native data structures with the conceptual models developers already use, Sui reduces the cognitive overhead required to translate between application logic and blockchain capabilities. This alignment is particularly valuable in gaming applications, where the ability to model complex asset relationships directly impacts gameplay possibilities.\nThe ecosystem's tool development further enhances the developer experience. Services like Enoki provide API access to Sui without requiring smart contract development, allowing for easier onboarding and features like gas abstraction or naming services. The Sui SDK offers comprehensive libraries for multiple languages, while the Sui Explorer provides enhanced visibility into network activities. These tools collectively reduce the specialized knowledge required to build on Sui, broadening the pool of potential developers beyond blockchain specialists to include mainstream software engineers.\nUnlike some blockchain platforms that excel primarily in DeFi or \"MemeFi\", Sui has attracted developers across gaming, social applications, infrastructure tools, and financial services. This breadth demonstrates Sui's capacity to foster innovation across multiple domains simultaneously—a critical factor for long-term ecosystem vitality. As the ecosystem expands, this diverse foundation acts as a rising tide that lifts all participants, creating network effects that benefit developers across all sectors. If/When the \"SUInami\" comes—that moment of explosive adoption and growth—it will be this broad-based foundation that provides stability and continued momentum across the entire ecosystem.\nWell-Suited for Fun and Games\nWhile DeFi has been a primary focus in the blockchain space, the Sui team places significant emphasis on gaming as a critical vertical for driving mainstream Web3 adoption. With 3.3 billion gamers worldwide and a global market valued at $241.1 billion in 2024, gaming represents a massive opportunity for bringing users into Web3. As highlighted by Sui's founders in the 'Sui Masterclass', the scale of this market is immense, generating \"more than movies more than music as a whole,\" and they believe \"gaming is huge and we think it's going to be the biggest adoption curve for Web3\".\nRecognizing that complexities like cumbersome wallets and unpredictable gas fees have created poor experiences in early Web3 games, Sui is engineered to overcome these barriers. The platform's technical architecture, including its object-centric data model and high performance, along with features like seamless user onboarding via zkLogin and sponsored transactions, provide developers with the tools needed to build truly engaging games and offer players genuine ownership and influence. This focus on delivering a superior user experience aligns with the team's broader mission. As Evan Cheng, CEO and co-founder of Mysten Labs, stated, \"Our mission is to bring the advantages of Web3 to billions. Creating products that genuinely attract user volume is our foremost priority.\" This commitment to user-centric design and leveraging Sui's unique capabilities positions gaming as a key driver for Sui's growth.\nThe gaming ecosystem on Sui has demonstrated extraordinary growth metrics, with daily transactions increasing from just 13,300 in January 2024 to 433,700 by December—a 32.5x surge in activity within a single year. Even more impressive is the growth in daily active users, which climbed from 2,400 to 195,800 during the same period—an 81.7x increase that suggests the emergence of genuinely engaging experiences rather than speculative token farming. This robust user engagement validates Sui's technical advantages for gaming applications: the 400ms finality enables real-time gameplay feedback, the object-centric data model naturally represents game assets and states, and the horizontal scaling approach prevents popular games from negatively impacting network performance.\nThe ecosystem's depth extends beyond metrics to include substantial studio participation, with 65 gaming studios now building on Sui and approximately 70 titles scheduled for release throughout 2025. These include established developers like Lucky Kat Studios (Panzerdogs), Blowfish Studios (DARKTIMES), and XOCIETY, who bring professional game development expertise rather than simply blockchain tokenomics. Unlike many previous \"blockchain gaming\" initiatives that prioritized financial incentives over gameplay, this new wave of development appears focused on creating compelling experiences that integrate blockchain functionality where it adds genuine value. They are building games first and blockchain second—the technology should enhance the fun, not be the reason people play. This gameplay-first approach represents a maturation of the blockchain gaming space and is more likely to attract mainstream gamers who care about entertainment value rather than tokenomics.\nUnderscoring its commitment to revolutionizing gaming, Mysten Labs is developing SuiPlay0X1, a dedicated gaming console envisioned as a next-generation gaming operating system. This ambitious project aims to bridge the gap between traditional Web2 games from various platforms, including Steam and Epic, alongside native Web3 games, all within a single device. By deeply integrating Sui at the operating system level, SuiPlay0X1 will offer seamless access to on-chain assets and functionalities, potentially featuring ZK login for easy account creation and NFT-based rewards for gameplay.&nbsp;\n\nSource: Sui Network’s X postThis initiative represents a bold step towards making blockchain technology an integral and user-friendly component of the mainstream gaming experience. As Evan Cheng describes it, SuiPlay0X1 is a gaming operating system that lets users play both traditional games and blockchain games on a single device, creating a seamless bridge between gaming paradigms. By creating dedicated hardware optimized for blockchain gaming, Sui positions itself not just as another platform for game developers, but as a potential category leader in an emerging gaming paradigm. The strategic timing and location of the Sui Gaming Summit alongside the mainstream Game Developers Conference further emphasizes this ambition to participate in the broader gaming conversation rather than remain isolated in a blockchain-specific niche.\nBeyond gaming, Sui's architecture enables other non-financial applications that benefit from its unique capabilities. The object-centric data model proves particularly valuable for NFT applications, with platforms like BlueMove leveraging Sui's Kiosk primitive to create decentralized marketplaces with native royalty enforcement and transfer restrictions. Kiosk is a decentralized commerce primitive that allows creators to enforce custom policies like royalties on asset trades while retaining asset custody until sale. Unlike NFT implementations on other blockchains that struggle to enforce creator rights—leading to widespread royalty evasion—Sui's built-in primitives enable powerful ownership mechanisms without compromising decentralization principles. This architectural advantage has attracted numerous creative projects beyond simple collectibles, including music rights management, digital identity solutions, and virtual real estate applications.\nLooking further ahead, Sui's founders have articulated a vision for the platform as a coordination layer for AI agents and decentralized marketplaces. As Adeniyi Abiodun explains, Sui can serve as a decentralized, neutral mechanism for AI agents to communicate and exchange value, creating an infrastructure layer for autonomous systems to interact with high performance and strong security guarantees. The combination of performant infrastructure, native ownership primitives, and user-friendly interfaces creates possibilities for AI-driven applications that can interact securely and efficiently on-chain. This perspective extends Sui's potential utility far beyond current blockchain applications, positioning it as infrastructure for emerging technological paradigms rather than merely an incremental improvement to existing blockchain use cases.\nSui's breadth of use cases highlights its ability to go beyond financial services, addressing a broader range of real-world challenges. From gaming and creative industries to AI-driven applications, Sui demonstrates blockchain's role in everyday applications where utility and enjoyable experiences are at the core. By prioritizing user-centric design and delivering tangible benefits, the network cements its position as a versatile and future-ready blockchain. This broad applicability not only accelerates mainstream adoption but also creates a robust foundation for sustainable growth across multiple domains, placing Sui at the forefront of the next wave of technological innovation while enabling it to weather market cycles and continue growing through multiple use cases simultaneously.\nCeFi-Like DeFi For the Retail and TradiFi\nFinancial applications represent the most mature use case for blockchain technology, yet most platforms have been forced to compromise between decentralization and market efficiency. Sui's approach to financial infrastructure demonstrates its comprehensive design philosophy, creating native solutions for challenges that other blockchains address through limited workarounds.\nThe clearest example of this approach is DeepBook, Sui's native Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) built directly into the protocol layer. While other blockchains typically rely on Automated Market Makers (AMMs) due to performance limitations, DeepBook provides the sophisticated market mechanics that institutional traders expect: price-time priority ordering, maker-taker fee models, and efficient price discovery.\nAMMs were essentially an ingenious compromise developed because legacy blockchain architectures couldn't support proper order books due to performance requirements and offered benefits like passive liquidity provision and execution guarantees in nascent markets. They were an innovative solution for their time, but they have inherent efficiency limitations compared to the CLOB model used in traditional finance. Sui's ground-up design with Move illustrates the classic innovator's dilemma in action—while established blockchains remain constrained by their foundational design choices, Sui's clean-slate approach enabled it to implement sophisticated financial primitives that established platforms struggle to match with patchwork solutions.\nDeepBook addresses several fundamental inefficiencies of AMMs: it eliminates impermanent loss for liquidity providers, enables limit orders that execute at exact prices rather than within price ranges, and significantly reduces slippage for large trades. The integration of this high-performance CLOB at the protocol level creates trading experiences more akin to traditional financial markets while maintaining decentralization principles. For institutional traders accustomed to sophisticated order types and execution strategies, DeepBook removes a critical barrier to blockchain adoption by providing familiar market mechanics rather than requiring adaptation to AMM peculiarities.\nThe practical impact of this architecture is evident in rapid market adoption and impressive metrics. By mid-December 2024, DeepBook approached $1 billion in cumulative trading volume, while overall DEX volumes on Sui expanded from $1.8 billion in September 2024 to $12.4 billion in January 2025—a nearly 600% increase in just four months. As of April 23, 2025, leading DEX Cetus ranks #4 globally by 24-hour trading volume with $186.4M, and #9 globally in 24-hour fee generation with approximately $573.8K in daily fees. In December 2024, it reached as high as #12 among all DEXs globally and #7 by weekly revenue, generating $2.1 million in revenue and $420K in fees. For perspective, the performance of its leading DEX Cetus places Sui on a relatively new Layer 1 in competition with established protocols on Ethereum (July 2015) and Solana (March 2020) that have had years to build liquidity and user bases. These metrics are impressive for a new blockchain and indicate that Sui's financial infrastructure is attracting meaningful economic activity rather than merely speculative interest.\n\nDeFi Llama data from April 23, 2025, indicates Cetus ranked 4th globally by 24-hour trading volume ($186.4M).Sui's financial ecosystem has seen remarkable growth in its stablecoin landscape, evolving from having no native stablecoins at launch to a robust and expanding market. Since the start of 2025, the total stablecoin market cap on Sui has surged dramatically, increasing from $373.74 million on January 1st to $888.8 million as of April 23, 2025—a growth of approximately 138.4%, representing a 2.38x increase.\n\nNotably, USDC holds a dominant position in the Sui stablecoin market, accounting for 73.93% of the total market cap as of April 23, 2025. This dominance is partly due to its impressive recent performance, showing a 63.1% increase in market cap over the past month. Beyond USDC, the ecosystem is supported by other major stablecoin implementations, including Tether's USDT, FDUSD, AUSD, and USDY, which collectively contribute to a comprehensive and growing stablecoin base essential for enabling reliable financial applications on Sui.\n\nLending markets have seen substantial deployment on Sui. As of April 23, 2025, several Sui protocols rank among the leaders by 7-day fee generation. These include Suilend at #7 ($390.5K Fees 7d, $488.5M TVL), Scallop Lend at #8 ($309.0K Fees 7d, $140.4M TVL), and NAVI Lending at #11 ($202.0K Fees 7d, $406.5M TVL). Notably, Suilend ranks #7 globally by both TVL and 7-day fees.\nPerpetuals trading platforms provide essential risk management and leveraged trading capabilities. Bluefin, for instance, demonstrates sophisticated derivatives capabilities, with monthly trading volume increasing from $151 million in October 2023 to an all-time high of $4.8 billion in December 2024, maintaining a robust $4.4 billion in January 2025. This addition completes Sui's core financial services offering, enabling the full spectrum of trading strategies required by active market participants.\n\nDeFi Llama Lending Rankings (Apr 23, 2025) by 7-day fees: Suilend #7 ($390.5K), Scallop #8 ($309.0K), NAVI #11 ($202.0K).This comprehensive infrastructure enables complex financial workflows rather than isolated transactions. The integration of fiat on-ramps and cross-chain bridges further enhances Sui's financial ecosystem. Major providers like MoonPay, Alchemy Pay, and Banxa enable users from over 160 countries to purchase SUI directly using traditional payment methods. Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) facilitates native USDC transfers across eight different chains, creating seamless liquidity flows. These gateways don't merely exist as separate components but function as an integrated system that enables capital to flow efficiently into and throughout the Sui ecosystem.\nA cornerstone of Sui's market position is how it effectively bridges the gap between blockchain capabilities and accessible financial utility. Through Spritzfinance integration, users can load SUI onto digital prepaid Visa cards, enabling direct payment for everyday expenses without cumbersome off-ramping processes. This practical application demonstrates how Sui's financial infrastructure extends beyond trading and lending to address real-world financial needs—a crucial evolutionary step for blockchain technology to achieve mainstream relevance.\nBabylon and Lombard Join Sui Ecosystem\nExpanding its BTCFi ecosystem, Sui has recently integrated with two prominent players in Bitcoin DeFi: Babylon Labs and Lombard Finance. Babylon, a key protocol for Bitcoin staking, has attracted significant value, previously amassing over $4 billion in total value locked (TVL). As of April 2025, this figure was around $2.68 billion, following a planned transition by Lombard Finance. Lombard Finance itself commands a substantial TVL of around $1.81 billion, largely secured on the Bitcoin network.\n\nSource: suipiens.com&nbsp;Babylon's integration with Sui, solidified in April 2025, is highlighted by the team as key to enhancing Sui's security by leveraging Bitcoin's robustness. According to Babylon, their modular Bitcoin staking protocol contributes to securing Sui's consensus layer, allowing Bitcoin holders to stake BTC directly on Sui while maintaining self-custody. This development, which the Babylon team highlights positions Sui to become a “Bitcoin Secured Network”' seeks to unlock Bitcoin's massive liquidity for decentralized finance applications within the Sui ecosystem.\nLombard Finance's expansion on March 5, 2025, brought its liquid-staked Bitcoin token, LBTC, to the Sui blockchain as its first deployment on a non-EVM chain. This move enables Bitcoin holders to mint LBTC on Sui and engage with various DeFi protocols, including lending, trading, and staking, thereby broadening Bitcoin's utility in DeFi and positioning Sui as a growing platform for BTCFi innovation.\nThese strategic integrations underscore Sui's emergence as a significant hub for Bitcoin-based decentralized finance, leveraging the substantial assets and infrastructure of both Babylon and Lombard.\nSui UI: Web2 Experience for Web3\nThe gap between Web2 and Web3 user experiences represents one of the most persistent barriers to mainstream blockchain adoption. Traditional onboarding processes require understanding complex concepts like private keys, seed phrases, and gas fees—creating significant friction that deters all but the most committed users. Achieving intuitive user experiences in Web3 often relies on effectively abstracting away complexities—as highlighted in our analysis. Great UX design is so intuitive that even a four-year-old can instinctively use products like an iPhone. Sui has approached this challenge through a suite of protocol-level innovations designed to make blockchain interactions as intuitive as traditional web applications.\nAs co-founder Evan Cheng bluntly states, \"Wallets are the dumbest thing we've ever built in crypto.\" This candid assessment captures a core philosophical commitment to abstracting away the complexities that have hindered mainstream blockchain adoption. Rather than forcing users to adapt to blockchain's technical peculiarities, Sui has reimagined the entire authentication and transaction experience to align with familiar Web2 patterns.\nWallet Infrastructure\nSui’s wallet ecosystem has achieved significant maturation through strategic integrations with major providers. Recent additions of Phantom and Backpack have brought their substantial user bases to Sui, complementing existing solutions like the native Sui wallet and OKX Wallet. All major wallets support advanced security features, including recent official Ledger hardware wallet integration, and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) solutions through Qredo for institutional-grade security. MetaMask users can also access Sui through the Sui MetaMask Snap, extending compatibility to one of the most widely used EVM wallets.\n\nLedger Live on SuizkLogin: A Key for Seamless Onboarding\nAs highlighted before, zkLogin specifically tackles the authentication challenge. This primitive allows users to access Sui applications using familiar Web2 logins, such as their Google, Facebook, or Twitch accounts, while cryptographically preserving the self-custody principles that make blockchain valuable. Technically implemented as a two-factor authentication scheme requiring both an OAuth credential and a user-managed salt, zkLogin eliminates the need for users to manage complex cryptographic keys or remember mnemonics. This creates an onboarding experience indistinguishable from signing into a traditional web application, while maintaining the security and ownership guarantees of blockchain technology. For mainstream users, this removes perhaps the most significant psychological barrier to blockchain adoption—the fear of losing access to assets through key management mistakes.\n\nSource: Sui Foundation Onboarding Made Simple with zkLoginWhat makes zkLogin particularly powerful is its composability with other Sui primitives. Developers can combine zkLogin with sponsored transactions to create experiences where users can sign in with familiar credentials and immediately begin transacting without needing to acquire tokens for gas fees. This can be further enhanced with multisig capabilities for additional security or with the Sui Name System for human-readable addressing. This layering of user-friendly primitives allows developers to craft increasingly frictionless experiences tailored to specific application needs without sacrificing blockchain's core benefits.\nGas Abstraction and Sui Name Service\nComplementing this authentication simplification is Sui's implementation of sponsored transactions, which addresses the persistent challenge of gas fees. By enabling applications to cover transaction costs on behalf of their users, this feature removes the circular problem where new users need to acquire tokens before they can even begin using a blockchain application. Some Sui applications are taking this concept even further, with the co-founders envisioning future models where users might cover transaction costs by simply watching advertisements or engaging with other familiar monetization approaches. As Evan Cheng explains, \"You might be able to transact just by watching an ad, completely abstracting away the concept of gas fees for casual users.\" This abstraction of blockchain economics allows users to experience the benefits of decentralized applications without first navigating cryptocurrency exchanges or understanding gas markets—significantly lowering the cognitive barriers to entry.\nBuilding upon this foundation, Sui introduces the Sui Native Name Service (SNS) with a powerful subdomain feature. Beyond simply replacing complex wallet addresses with human-readable names, SNS allows users and applications to create subdomains, fostering an intuitive organizational structure. For instance, a user with the top-level name \"Nebuchadnezzar\" could create subdomains like \"savings@nebuchadnezzar\" or \"collectibles@nebuchadnezzar\" for different purposes. This email-like notation extends the usability of Sui names, making it even more familiar for Web2 users and enabling a more organized digital identity within the Sui ecosystem. With over 300,000 names already registered, alongside a growing number of subdomains, SNS is rapidly becoming a core component of the Sui user experience.\nThese user-centric innovations have enabled the development of applications that rival traditional financial services in usability. Projects like Stash demonstrate how Sui can support experiences similar to Venmo or Cash App, allowing users to log in with email or Web2 identities and send money instantly using intuitive identifiers. A typical Stash user experience involves logging in with a Google account via zkLogin, then sending funds to \"snoopdog@stash\" rather than a complex alphanumeric address. The recipient gets a notification and can immediately access their funds without needing to create a traditional crypto wallet or manage keys. This experience is virtually indistinguishable from familiar payment applications, representing a significant evolution from the complex interfaces and workflows that have characterized most blockchain applications, potentially opening the door to users who would never have engaged with traditional cryptocurrency interfaces.\nThe impact of these innovations extends beyond individual applications to the broader ecosystem. By reducing onboarding friction, Sui has enabled exponential growth in active accounts—expanding from 584,000 in June 2023 to 45.3 million by early 2025, a 77.5x increase. The convergence of simplified authentication, abstracted transaction costs, and intuitive naming creates an environment where crypto tech can fade into the background, allowing users to focus on the value and utility of applications rather than the underlying infrastructure. This may be the most important step toward achieving mainstream blockchain adoption.\nLeadership and Institutional Backing\nExecutive Team &amp; Technical Expertise\nSui Network's team brings together an exceptional team of former Meta (Facebook) engineers who previously worked on the Diem blockchain and Move programming language. This technical pedigree is evident in the protocol's architecture and execution. The founding team includes Evan Cheng (CEO), a 27-year tech industry veteran and co-recipient of the 2012 ACM System Award who spent 10 years at Apple leading developer tooling and programming language initiatives before his 6.5 years at Meta where he led the Libra R&amp;D team; Sam Blackshear (CTO), the principal creator of the Move programming language; Adeniyi Abiodun (CPO), who built one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in the world after working in finance and later launched blockchain products at Oracle and VMware before joining Meta's Novi division (Meta's digital wallet initiative for cryptocurrency payments); and George Danezis (Chief Scientist), a renowned expert in security and privacy with significant experience at Microsoft and University College London.\nInstitutional Capital &amp; Investment Rounds\nThe project has attracted substantial institutional investment across multiple rounds, raising a total of $385.37M. The Series A round in December 2021 raised $36M at a $1.8B valuation, with participation from notable investors including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Samsung Next, and Coinbase Ventures. This was followed by a significant Series B round in September 2022, raising $300M at a $2.5B valuation, with investments from Circle Ventures, Jump Capital, and Binance Labs, among others.\nThe public token sales phase in April-May 2023 raised an additional $49.37M through various IEO platforms including OKX Jumpstart and KuCoin Spotlight. The vesting schedules were structured to ensure long-term alignment, with Series A vesting completed in January 2024 and Series B in October 2024. The public rounds followed a more accelerated schedule with monthly unlocks, demonstrating a balanced approach to token distribution.\n\nSource: Sui (SUI) IEO Funding Rounds, Token Sale Review &amp; Tokenomics Analysis | CryptoRank.ioThis combination of deep technical expertise and strong institutional backing has provided Sui with both the intellectual and financial resources necessary for long-term ecosystem development.\nBuilding with Institutions: Momentum and Collaboration\nInstitutional adoption represents a critical validation signal for blockchain technology, indicating the transition from experimental infrastructure to production-ready systems capable of supporting significant financial and technological operations. Sui's rapid institutional engagement across multiple sectors provides perhaps the strongest evidence of its long-term potential beyond purely technical metrics or retail adoption.\nThe financial sector's embrace of Sui has been particularly noteworthy for both its breadth and the caliber of institutions involved. VanEck's introduction of regulated SUI-backed financial products in November 2024 marked a significant milestone, expanding access to traditional investment portfolios and retirement accounts. Franklin Templeton's strategic ecosystem partnership, announced just nine days later, was even more surprising—this 77-year-old asset manager with over $1.5 trillion under management isn't known for technological experimentation, making their commitment particularly validating. A compelling indicator of institutional confidence emerged with Grayscale Investments' SUI Trust launch in September 2024. As the largest digital asset manager globally, Grayscale's product selection process is notoriously selective, typically focusing on only the most established cryptocurrencies. Their relatively early commitment to Sui suggests extraordinary confidence in the protocol's long-term position.\nExpanding its reach into traditional financial markets, Sui has recently announced a significant collaboration with the ATHEX Group, the entity supporting the organization and development of the Greek Capital Market. This partnership brings Greece's national stock exchange onchain with Sui, with Mysten Labs and ATHEX working together to build a ZK-powered fundraising platform. This initiative highlights how Sui's technology is being leveraged to enhance privacy and speed within traditional capital markets, showcasing real-world finance meeting next-gen blockchain.\nThese financial products are complemented by infrastructure partnerships that enhance Sui's institutional capabilities. Circle's integration brings native USDC to the ecosystem, providing the stable value foundation required for serious institutional participation. Copper's custody solutions enable secure asset management for enterprise users, while Zero Hash and Fordefi provide institutional-grade transaction infrastructure. This comprehensive suite of financial services creates an environment where traditional institutions can engage with Sui without compromising their operational requirements or regulatory obligations—a crucial factor that has limited institutional adoption of many other blockchain platforms.\nTechnology partnerships further extend Sui's institutional reach beyond finance. The collaboration with Google Cloud goes beyond basic infrastructure support to include deeper AI integration capabilities and enterprise-grade security implementations. This relationship provides not just technical enhancements but also significant credibility with traditional enterprises exploring blockchain adoption. Similarly, the partnership with BytePlus (ByteDance's enterprise technology subsidiary) expands Sui's reach into Asian markets while potentially enabling novel applications at the intersection of social media, content delivery, and blockchain verification—a combination that could prove particularly powerful as digital content authenticity becomes increasingly valuable.\nAnother notable evolution is how these institutional relationships are increasingly bidirectional rather than simply validational. Franklin Templeton isn't merely investing in Sui but actively participating in ecosystem development through its digital asset arm. Google Cloud's partnership involves mutual technology development rather than simple service provision. This evolution from passive investment to active collaboration suggests that institutions are beginning to view Sui not just as a speculative blockchain play but as strategic infrastructure worth integrating into their long-term technology strategies.\nThe convergence of these institutional relationships creates substantial network effects that benefit the entire Sui ecosystem. Financial products generate liquidity and price discovery mechanisms that attract additional capital. Infrastructure partnerships enhance security and reliability, making the network more attractive for developers building mission-critical applications. Technology collaborations expand Sui's capabilities into new domains, potentially opening entirely new market segments. Collectively, these institutional engagements create a foundation for sustainable growth that extends well beyond retail speculation or short-term token appreciation—they position Sui as serious infrastructure for the future financial and technological landscape, establishing a relationship that is mutualistic, not parasitic, where all participants contribute to and benefit from the network's growth..\nThe Competitive Landscape\nIn the Layer 1 blockchain landscape, Sui primarily competes with two major protocols: Aptos, sharing the Move programming language heritage, and Solana, which similarly emphasizes high performance and low costs. Understanding this competitive dynamics provides crucial context for evaluating Sui's market position and long-term potential.\nThe technical architectures of these protocols reveal philosophically different approaches to blockchain scalability and performance. Sui's Mysticeti consensus achieves sub-400ms finality through its innovative DAG-based structure and parallel transaction processing. This significantly outperforms both Aptos, which targets 800ms finality with its Raptr upgrade, and Solana's 2-3 second finality using Proof-of-History. While these performance differences might seem marginal in abstract terms, they represent fundamental capabilities gaps for applications where transaction confirmation directly impacts user experience, such as gaming or high-frequency trading.\n\nAnalysis of finality times, consensus mechanisms, and scaling approachesBeyond comparative benchmarks, the contrasting philosophies toward scaling highlight the deeper strategic differences at play. Sui has embraced horizontal scaling, designing its architecture to maintain performance as more validators join the network and activity increases. This contrasts sharply with Solana's vertical scaling philosophy, which prioritizes maximizing the performance of individual validators through increasingly powerful hardware requirements. The practical implications of this difference become apparent during periods of network stress: while Solana has experienced several complete network outages during periods of high demand, Sui's architecture is specifically designed to avoid \"penalizing success\" through surge pricing or performance degradation when popular applications drive increased usage.\nThis architectural distinction extends to gas fees and pricing models. Sui employs a predictable gas fee structure where validators set reference prices per epoch, enabling reliable cost estimation for users and developers. This contrasts with the highly variable gas fees experienced on blockchains like Ethereum and increasingly on Solana during periods of congestion. The stability of Sui's fee structure makes it particularly suitable for applications with frequent microtransactions, such as gaming or social applications, where unpredictable fee spikes can severely disrupt user experience.\nFrom an ecosystem development perspective, the relationship between Sui, Aptos, and Solana demonstrates fascinating patterns of competition and collaboration. Sui and Aptos share the Move programming language foundation, creating network effects that benefit both chains as developers can leverage their Move expertise across multiple platforms. This has accelerated the broader Move ecosystem development while allowing each chain to differentiate through their unique technical capabilities.\nThe relationship with Solana's ecosystem shows an emerging pattern of expansion rather than migration. The integration of the Wormhole bridge between Sui and Solana has facilitated cross-chain liquidity flows, while established Solana protocols like Solend have expanded to Sui through implementations like Suilend. This multi-chain deployment strategy by developers suggests the emergence of a blockchain landscape characterized by specialized capabilities rather than winner-take-all dynamics.\nEcosystem metrics provide quantitative context for this competitive positioning. As of February 2025, Solana leads with approximately $12.1B in TVL, demonstrating its position as a mature DeFi ecosystem. Sui follows with $2.53B TVL, showing impressive growth from $257M in January 2024. Aptos currently maintains $964M in TVL. What's particularly notable about Sui's growth trajectory is its velocity—achieving over 10x TVL growth in just one year suggests momentum that could eventually challenge Solana's position if sustained.\n\nDeFi Llama data (Jan 19, 2025) contrasts Solana's $12.19B TVL with Sui's rapidly expanding $1.96B.Fee generation offers perhaps the most valuable insight into actual economic activity. While Solana currently leads with multiple protocols generating substantial fees, Sui's leading applications are showing remarkable growth trajectories. Cetus, Sui's leading DEX, ranks #40 globally with approximately $9M in monthly fees—an impressive achievement for a protocol less than two years old.\nLooking beyond current metrics to future trends, Sui's comprehensive approach to blockchain infrastructure—balancing technical excellence with developer experience and user accessibility—positions it uniquely in the competitive landscape. Rather than competing solely on performance or ecosystem size, Sui offers a distinct value proposition through the integration of multiple capabilities that collectively address the full spectrum of blockchain adoption barriers. This multi-dimensional approach may ultimately prove more sustainable than the more focused strategies employed by some competitors.\nTokenomics and Community Engagement\nA blockchain's economic model and community dynamics play crucial roles in its long-term sustainability and growth potential. Sui's approach to both these dimensions reflects a deliberate strategy focused on quality over quantity and long-term alignment over short-term speculation, a strategy we've explored extensively in our 3-part analysis.\nSui's tokenomics are built around a fixed maximum supply of 10 billion SUI tokens. A detailed allocation and controlled release schedule are central to balancing ecosystem growth with price stability and preventing short-term speculation. Unlike many Layer 1 blockchains that distribute significant portions of their token supply through airdrops, Sui has deliberately avoided this approach in favor of more selective mechanisms, a decision rooted in the view that airdrops can attract a 'bad crowd,' as noted by one Sui team member. However, as we have argued in our extensive research “Airdropping: Some Truths”, the outcome is often dependent on the way an airdrop is properly designed. As Evan Cheng explains, \"We made a conscious decision not to do traditional airdrops. We wanted to attract a community of genuinely interested participants who are here for the technology and long-term potential, not just short-term token rewards.\" This strategy aims to cultivate a community of genuinely interested participants rather than short-term profit seekers—a distinction that has proven increasingly valuable as the ecosystem matures.\nThe token allocation is structured to ensure long-term alignment and broad distribution over time. Key allocations include a significant portion for Community Reserves, Stake Subsidies, and funds allocated after 2030, alongside distributions to Early Contributors, Series A, and Series B investors. The vesting schedule, which governs the timing of token unlocks for various participants, is a crucial component of this controlled release mechanism, impacting the circulating supply over time. Detailed information on the allocation breakdown and vesting schedule is available, sourced from data providers like CryptoRank.\n\nSUI Token Allocation Breakdown. Source: CryptoRankThe token's utility encompasses multiple functions within the ecosystem. SUI serves as the native gas token for transaction fees, provides governance rights for protocol decisions, and enables staking for network security. With 32.5% of the total supply in circulation as of April 2025, the controlled release of tokens helps prevent price volatility while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Approximately 50% of all tokens are allocated to community initiatives including developer grants, educational programs, and ecosystem growth. The current staking APY of approximately 2.5% represents a sustainable emission rate that rewards long-term holders without excessive dilution. This balanced approach to staking rewards contributes to the token's monetary premium while ensuring network security through sufficient validator participation.\n\nSUI Vesting Schedule Breakdown. Source: CryptoRankCommunity engagement extends far beyond tokenomics to include robust educational initiatives, developer support programs, and regional growth strategies. The Sui Foundation's grant program, offering between $10,000 and $100,000 to promising projects, has catalyzed ecosystem development across multiple verticals. The Sui Global Accelerator Program provides more comprehensive support for high-potential teams, including funding, technical guidance, and business development assistance. These programs collectively foster organic ecosystem growth by empowering developers to build applications that leverage Sui's unique capabilities.\nThe community's composition reflects Sui's deliberate focus on quality engagement. By avoiding indiscriminate token distribution, Sui has attracted participants with genuine interest in the platform's capabilities rather than purely speculative motivations. This community quality manifests in substantive technical discussions, constructive feedback on protocol improvements, and collaborative problem-solving across development challenges. The sustained growth in developer participation—from 13 to 892 monthly active developers—demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in cultivating a vibrant builder community.\nThe community has also played a crucial role in refining Sui's user-centric features. For example, feedback from early zkLogin implementations led to improvements in the authentication flow and additional privacy protections, creating a more seamless experience for mainstream users. This responsive development approach creates a virtuous cycle where community input directly enhances the platform's capabilities, which in turn attracts more users and developers.\nRegional initiatives have further expanded Sui's global reach and cultural diversity. The protocol has established strong presences in key markets including North America, Europe, and Asia, with particular momentum in emerging blockchain hubs like Singapore and Dubai. This geographic distribution not only enhances network resilience but also enables the ecosystem to incorporate diverse perspectives and use cases that reflect different regional priorities and regulatory environments.\nEducational resources play a critical role in community building and expansion. The Sui Academy provides structured learning pathways for developers at various skill levels, while regular workshops and hackathons offer hands-on experience with the platform's capabilities. These educational initiatives reduce barriers to entry for new developers while ensuring that existing builders can fully leverage Sui's advanced features. The feedback loop between education, development, and community growth creates a virtuous cycle that continually strengthens the ecosystem.\nThe interconnection between tokenomics and community engagement represents one of Sui's most subtle but significant strengths. By aligning economic incentives with long-term ecosystem development rather than short-term speculation, Sui has created an environment where community participation naturally contributes to platform growth and value creation. This alignment positions the protocol for sustainable expansion driven by genuine utility rather than market cycles—a crucial distinction in the volatile blockchain landscape.\nFuture Growth Vectors\nLooking beyond current achievements to future possibilities, several key vectors are likely to shape Sui's continued evolution and market position. These growth paths build upon existing strengths while expanding into emerging opportunities that leverage Sui's unique capabilities.\nThe gaming vertical represents perhaps the most immediately promising expansion opportunity. With 65 studios actively building on Sui and over 70 titles scheduled for release throughout 2025, the platform is positioned to capture significant market share in the nascent blockchain gaming sector. The SuiPlay0X1 hardware initiative further strengthens this position by creating dedicated infrastructure optimized for blockchain gaming experiences. As traditional gaming studios increasingly explore blockchain integration, Sui's combination of high performance, developer-friendly tools, and user-accessible features provides compelling advantages over competing platforms.\nInstitutional adoption presents another significant growth vector. The existing relationships with financial institutions like VanEck, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale provide a foundation for deeper integration with traditional finance. These partnerships are increasingly bidirectional, with institutions not merely investing in Sui but actively participating in ecosystem development. Franklin Templeton isn't just offering SUI-backed financial products but engaging directly with protocol development through its digital asset arm. This evolution from passive investment to active collaboration suggests institutions view Sui as strategic infrastructure worth integrating into their long-term technology strategies rather than just another speculative asset.\nAs regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue to mature, Sui's institutional-grade infrastructure—including native USDC integration, advanced trading venues like DeepBook, and comprehensive custody solutions—positions it to capture increasing institutional capital flows. The potential development of regulated financial products built directly on Sui, rather than merely tracking its token price, could create powerful new connections between blockchain capabilities and traditional financial services.\nReal-world asset (RWA) tokenization emerges as a promising frontier that builds upon Sui's existing strengths. The protocol's combination of institutional-grade security, high performance, and programmable ownership makes it well-suited for representing traditional assets on-chain. Early implementations like USDY demonstrate the potential for bringing real-world yield to blockchain environments, while partnerships with companies like Copper provide the necessary custody infrastructure for institutional RWA adoption. As traditional assets increasingly migrate to blockchain representations, Sui's architecture offers advantages in security, scalability, and user accessibility that could position it as a preferred platform for this emerging sector.\nAI integration represents a more speculative but potentially transformative growth vector. Sui's founders have articulated a vision for the blockchain as a coordination layer for AI agents, enabling secure and efficient interaction between autonomous systems. As Adeniyi Abiodun explains, \"Sui can serve as a decentralized, neutral mechanism for AI agents to communicate and exchange value.\" The combination of performant infrastructure, native ownership primitives, and programmable transaction capabilities creates possibilities for AI-driven applications that can transact and coordinate on-chain. While this integration remains in early stages, the strategic partnership with Google Cloud enhances Sui's positioning to capture opportunities at the intersection of AI and blockchain—potentially one of the most significant technological convergences in the coming years.\nCross-chain interoperability continues to grow in importance as the blockchain landscape evolves toward a multi-chain reality rather than single-chain dominance. Sui's existing bridges to Ethereum and other major chains, coupled with integration of Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), position it as a connected participant in the broader blockchain ecosystem. Future enhancements to cross-chain functionality, potentially including more sophisticated asset transfers and cross-chain smart contract interactions, could further strengthen Sui's role as both a standalone platform and a complementary environment within the broader blockchain landscape.\nTechnical roadmap advancements will build upon Sui's existing architectural advantages. Continued optimization of the Mysticeti consensus mechanism could further improve finality times and throughput, while additional protocol-level primitives may enhance developer capabilities and user experiences. The ongoing evolution of the Move language ecosystem, including improved development tools and formal verification methods, will likely strengthen Sui's position as a secure and developer-friendly platform. These technical improvements, while perhaps less visible than market-facing initiatives, provide the foundation for all other growth vectors by continuously enhancing the platform's fundamental capabilities.\nAcross all these vectors, Sui's comprehensive approach to blockchain infrastructure—balancing technical excellence, developer experience, and user accessibility—creates multiple paths for continued growth and adoption. Rather than relying on a single breakout application or market segment, this diversified strategy positions Sui to capture opportunities across multiple domains simultaneously, reducing dependency on any particular trend or market cycle. This multi-dimensional growth potential represents perhaps the strongest argument for Sui's long-term position in the blockchain landscape.\nConclusion: More Than the Sum of Its Parts\nBlockchain success ultimately derives not from any single technological breakthrough but from the careful orchestration of multiple elements working in harmony. Sui exemplifies this principle through a comprehensive design philosophy that addresses the full spectrum of adoption barriers simultaneously rather than focusing narrowly on isolated metrics or capabilities.\nWhat distinguishes Sui isn't that it achieves absolute superiority in any particular dimension—though its 400ms finality, native CLOB, and zkLogin features certainly represent category-leading innovations—but rather that it maintains excellence across the entire constellation of factors that influence blockchain adoption and utility. The Move programming language provides security by design, while parallel transaction execution enables performance at scale. Programmable Transaction Blocks lower development barriers, while sponsored transactions and zkLogin remove user friction. DeepBook offers institutional-grade trading infrastructure, while the Sui Name System makes blockchain interactions intuitive for mainstream users.\nThis multifaceted approach has translated into remarkable growth across all key ecosystem metrics. From 13 million to 8.44 billion total transactions in less than two years. From $257 million to a peak of $3.5 billion in TVL in just one year. From 584,000 to 45.3 million active accounts. From 13 to 892 monthly active developers. These aren't just impressive numbers—they're validation signals demonstrating that Sui's comprehensive strategy resonates with the market's needs and expectations.\nSui's core impact on the ecosystem stems from narrowing the gap between blockchain capabilities and practical real-world utility. Through initiatives like Spritzfinance's debit card integration, Stash's Venmo-like payment experience, and SuiPlay0X1's dedicated gaming hardware, Sui is extending blockchain functionality beyond crypto-native users to mainstream applications. This practical utility, combined with growing institutional adoption through partnerships with companies like Franklin Templeton, Google Cloud, and Circle, positions Sui at the convergence point of consumer and institutional blockchain adoption—potentially the sweet spot for capturing the next wave of blockchain growth.\nAs the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, the projects most likely to achieve sustained relevance aren't those with the highest theoretical transaction throughput or the most novel consensus mechanism, but those that solve the complete puzzle of what makes distributed systems valuable to users, developers, and institutions. By maintaining balance across technical excellence, developer experience, and user accessibility, Sui exemplifies this holistic approach to blockchain infrastructure—less a single innovation than a constellation of capabilities working together to create something greater than the sum of its parts.\nIn a field often captivated by singular breakthroughs and isolated metrics, Sui reminds us that true technological revolutions rarely hinge on doing one thing extraordinarily well, but rather on doing many things extraordinarily well together. This lesson extends beyond blockchain to all emerging technologies: lasting impact comes not from isolated brilliance but from comprehensive excellence across the full spectrum of factors that transform technological potential into practical utility.\n\nWe value your insights.

And let me tell you, if you thought 2024 was crazy, wait till you see what’s coming next.\nIn 2025 we’re going way beyond “faster finality.”\nWe’re designing a future where Sui’s core engine becomes the backbone for finance, gaming, AI-driven agents, and everyday apps.\n2025 will prove that Sui is the first blockchain that can handle every piece of that puzzle from start to finish.\nSo, let’s dive in.\nLast Year We Delivered Sub-Second Finality; This Year We’re Taking It Even Further\nWith Mysticeti V1, we showed the world how a DAG-based (Directed Acyclic Graph) consensus could deliver sub-second finality under heavy load.\nBut since the moment we started designing Sui's core architecture, we knew our initial consensus design wasn’t the final word.\nOur plan from day one was to build a chain architecture flexible enough to evolve once real builders came knocking with real needs.\nThat moment arrived in 2024 when developers, especially DeFi folks, pushed Sui’s shared-object model to the limit.\nSub-second finality was already a selling point, but DeFi demanded near-instantaneous finality for shared assets.\nThis meant cutting the last bit of latency, boosting throughput, and giving developers a simpler, more direct path to building lightning-fast apps.\nThat’s exactly what Mysticeti V2 is all about.\nSui's current architecture follows a \"two-protocol\" design.\nWe had a consistent broadcast layer and a consensus layer running in tandem, which meant your average transaction needed a flurry of signatures and message exchanges just to get validated.\nBy the time all the certificates are aggregated, the system piles up a whole bunch of cryptographic checks. This leaves only fewer CPU cycles available for efficiently executing user transactions.\nMysticeti V2 / FastPath basically bakes that broadcast logic right into the DAG itself.\nInstead of pinging every validator for multiple signatures and gluing them back together, we’re paring things down to fewer certificates, fewer heavy crypto ops, and a lot less back-and-forth.\nPractically, it will feel more like a classic transaction processing system: submit once to a validator, see it come out confirmed, and you’re good.\nNo more micromanaging a gazillion signatures or messing with complicated fallback flows. It’s all handled under the hood.\nWhat’s the payoff?\nFor starters, validators are no longer swamped verifying big piles of proofs, so they can push more CPU power into actual transaction execution.\nThat means you will see more throughput and lower latency, plus simpler transaction flows.\nWhat I’m personally excited about is how seamlessly this evolution fits into Sui’s architecture.\nThat let us seamlessly swap out Mysticeti V1 for Mysticeti V2, with no painful reboots for our validators and no massive disruptions for devs.\nWe’re aiming to roll this out thoughtfully in 2025 to ensure we keep that speed-stability balance we pride ourselves on.\nAnd once we’ve tuned a single validator to the absolute max, the next move is to multiply that capacity by scaling beyond one machine.\nThe Speed Barrier is Already Broken; Now, Remora Will Keep Sui Scaling With Demand\nBack when we first showed the world that Sui could finalize transactions in under a second, folks were already asking, “How long until you hit a bottleneck?”\nThe truth is, as any blockchain grows, there’s only so much you can push a single validator node before you’re hitting 100% CPU or rolling over memory limits.\nWe knew that if you throw hundreds of thousands of transactions per second at a single validator, no matter how well you tune the hardware, you’ll eventually max out.\nBut the promise of Sui is that it will never run out of capacity to process transactions when demand hits the network.\nNot by magically claiming 'infinite bandwidth,' but by letting us scale resources so we can handle any traffic spike without breaking a sweat or ballooning your fees.\nThat’s why the next natural step in 2025 isn’t just about going faster on one big machine, it’s about spreading the work across many.\nYes, we’re turning what used to be a single-track process into a massively parallel system that can scale out as easily as you can add more hardware.\nSo, we set out to crack the horizontal-scaling puzzle, starting with our Pilotfish research.\nPilotfish gave us a glimpse of how linear scaling should look: you add more machines to the validator cluster, and you get a straight-up multiplication in TPS without wrecking your sub-second finality.\nThat research evolved into Remora, a family of techniques that systematically splits validator workloads across multiple machines.\nNo matter the complexity (be it DeFi mania or a huge on-chain gaming spree), Sui can adapt.\nThose initial results looked so good that not only did we keep pushing, but universities started contributing, too.\nSo far, the results have been mind-blowing.\nIn test environments, we’re already clocking throughput in the hundreds of thousands of transactions per second (tps), and we’re not done yet.\nWhat’s cool is that we’re doing this in a way real validators can actually run. You won’t need a single supercomputer hidden in a data center; you can piece together a cluster of smaller machines.\nWe’re taking it slow and steady, of course.\nWe’re watching how DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and data-heavy apps start testing the limits of single-machine validators.\nBy the time real-world use cases actually demand five or ten times more throughput, Remora will be primed to deliver it without forcing a complete tear-down of your existing infrastructure.\nWe’re basically future-proofing Sui so that, as the network grows, we don’t lose our biggest advantage: unbeatable speed.\nBottom line: if you thought last year’s performance lifts were impressive, Remora will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\nOf course, once you’ve got a chain that’s effectively unbounded in throughput, you can start doing some pretty wild off-chain interactions that eventually settle on Sui.\nAnd that’s exactly where Programmable P2P Tunnels come into play.\nOn-Chain Is Blazing Fast; Let’s Supercharge Off-Chain Transactions Too\nWhen people first hear about “off-chain tunnels,” they often think of Lightning Network for Bitcoin, just a simple, closed-ended channel for P2P payments.\nOn Sui, though, we’re dialing that concept up a notch with Programmable P2P Tunnels.\nlink:https://x.com/kostascrypto/status/1872518706837766299\nThese P2P tunnels aren’t just for one-off transfers. they’re built to handle anything from low-latency grocery payments to real-time game logic.\nIt can even enable multi-player interactions that reintroduce their final state on-chain when you’re done.\nThat means you can lock some SUI tokens (or any Sui-based asset) into a tunnel, collaborate or transact off-chain, then close it out and confirm everything on-chain in a single sweep. Best part: Sui’s programmable P2P tunnels can provide unlimited throughput with zero latency.\nHow’s that possible? The secret sauce is combining a few key elements you won’t easily find elsewhere.\nSince we treat each asset or data chunk as its own object, you can create as many tunnels as you want, no global contention.\nNeed extra privacy for a casino game or a complex P2P arrangement? You can slip in zero-knowledge proofs so that neither side sees the other’s details until it’s all wrapped up.\nFor complex use cases (like storing partial game states),@WalrusProtocol&nbsp;provides a robust off-chain file storage layer that’s still cryptographically tied to Sui.\nAnd because we’re hiding all the complexity, like specialized cryptography or transaction bundling, behind a developer-friendly interface, the overhead for devs is minimal.\nOn top of that, Mysten Labs is actively collaborating with researchers&nbsp;@CarnegieMellon(Carnegie Mellon University) to further develop and refine these programmable P2P tunnels.\nNow, once you have all that raw capacity to play with, the conversation naturally turns to how transactions get ordered and prioritized in a fair manner. Especially under heavy load.\nWe’re Not Just Patching MEV; We’re Rewriting The Playbook\nRaw speed doesn’t help if users get front-run left and right.\nFor most blockchains, “MEV” sounds like a dirty word, a hidden tax on users.\nBots front-run your trades, pocket huge gains, and the average user just gets burned.\nSIP-45 is here to bring clarity.\nhttps://github.com/sui-foundation/sips/pull/45\nIt not only raises the gas-price ceiling (so you can bid more if it truly matters), but it also changes the rules of how transactions get broadcasted and slotted into the chain.\nThe goal? Make it more predictable to pay for guaranteed inclusion when it’s actually worth it.\nSure, you’ll see more intense gas-bidding wars if a thousand people all want to mutate that same liquidity pool object.\nYou might be thinking: So is this just another pay-to-win scenario where big spenders always cut the line?\nActually, the point is to give everyone, devs, validators, even everyday users, a clearer picture of who’s paying what and how those fees get priority.\nAt the same time, this also paves the way for some truly creative MEV solutions.\nThink redistributing part of that “rush to trade” profit back to users or staking participants, rather than letting a handful of malicious searchers siphon it all.\nOf course, we’re not naïve. MEV can’t just be wished away.\nBut if you can structure it so that regular folks get a piece of the upside, everything changes. Protocols can defend themselves from front-runs and sandwich attacks.\nWe’re designing a future where MEV isn’t a zero-sum game but a public resource fueling the entire ecosystem. SIP-45 gets that ball rolling by setting a fair playing field for ordering logic.\nlink:https://x.com/w_riches/status/1873923352332800012\nBut SIP-45 is just the first step in taming MEV.\nDeeper projects like DAG observability (giving the entire network real-time insight into incoming transactions) ensure no single party holds an “information advantage.”\nWe’re creating a platform that doesn’t just shrug at high contention. We want high volume, we want intense usage, and we want a system that handles it with fairness built in.\nBut we’re not stopping there.\nDecentralized Storage Used to Be Clunky; Walrus Changes Everything\nIn Q1 2025, Walrus Is Hitting the Mainnet.\nWalrus is our bold new approach to storing data at scale, built natively on Sui’s coordination layer.\nIt’s not just some IPFS-like file dump.\nWalrus is our vision of a distributed storage layer that runs with the same ethos as Sui itself: no single point of failure, massive scalability, and a built-in sustainable economic model.\nMost blockchain storage systems stop at basic file saving or referencing.\nWalrus goes further by letting developers build rules, compose with smart contracts, and unlock new use cases for data.\nWith Walrus, you can build truly end-to-end decentralized Apps.\nYou can store front-end files, user-generated content, or anything else you need. All of it is governed by the same trustless principles that Sui applies to the rest of the stack.\nSoon anyone can anchor an entire website front-end, user files, or even large AI model artifacts into Walrus.\nBy using Sui’s object model, each piece of data can be treated like a strongly typed object on-chain.\nDevelopers can now tie storage events directly into Sui smart contracts, letting them spin up dynamic applications.\nSuddenly, large-scale data that used to be locked away in someone’s AWS bucket can be globally accessible, programmatically managed, and transparent in terms of who’s storing what.\nYet raw decentralized storage is only half the story.\nIf everything is plain text by default, you can’t very well build a DocuSign alternative or a private Dropbox on top of it.\nThat’s where ‘SEAL’ steps in.\nWe’ve Got Storage Figured Out; Now SEAL Is Making Data Privacy &amp; Access Control a Non-Issue\nSEAL is an encryption and access-control framework designed to give your data the confidentiality it demands, complete with sophisticated, programmable policies.\nThink of SEAL as the rulebook that says, “These addresses can decrypt this data, under these exact conditions.”\nYou might be streaming a high-definition video, or building a DocuSign-type workflow where only specific parties can unlock the legal documents.\nWith SEAL, you’re not forced to rely on naive “public or private” storage.\nInstead, you define the cryptographic policies that say, “Grant read access to user X for a week, then revoke it. Or require a certain on-chain event, like a contract signature, before data is shared.\nThis synergy of Walrus and SEAL delivers the Holy Grail for decentralized apps: a place to store big data plus a built-in mechanism for robust encryption and policy enforcement.\nBuilding “Dropbox on Sui” or “Netflix on Sui” doesn’t have to be a pipe dream anymore; you actually have the primitives to make it real.\nAnd because Walrus is set to arrive in mainnet form soon, 2025 is shaping up to be the year we see the next generation of enterprise-grade Web3 apps.\nStoring data on a chain is one thing; unlocking it seamlessly, conditionally, and securely is the game-changer.\nAll of this sets the stage for the next step in Sui’s evolution: ensuring that we can route data and transactions in a way that’s path-aware, stable, and extra resilient.\nSui’s Core Is Fortified; It’s Time Reinforce Sui’s Networking Layer With SCION\nWhen we talk about building an internet-ready blockchain, there’s one massive elephant in the room: the internet itself is far from bulletproof.\nYou can have the most secure consensus and the best cryptography, but if your packets get hijacked halfway around the world, all that blockchain security goes out the window.\nThat’s exactly why we’re embedding SCION into Sui’s global validator network.\nBy integrating SCION, Sui can bypass the endless single points of failure we rely on in the conventional internet.\nWe’re talking robust, unstoppable connectivity that seamlessly survives DNS hacks, BGP hijacks, and massive DDoS floods, all while preserving the open nature that blockchains stand for.\nlink:&nbsp;https://x.com/SuiNetwork/status/1841968585578840299\nIn 2025, we’re aiming for Sui Mainnet to fully adopt SCION under the hood.\nThat means the network gets triple redundancy, multiple SCION paths, multiple providers, plus a fallback to standard IP if needed.\nThat’s a real game-changer.\nBut none of this matters if building on Sui still feels too complicated or if devs can’t easily leverage all this horsepower.\nThat’s why, in 2025, we’re doubling down on developer experience and all the tooling that makes shipping on Sui feel just as smooth.\nThe Tech Barriers Are Conquered; Now Let’s Make Building on Sui Effortless for Devs\nSui is already the blockchain with the best DevEx in the whole industry.\nlink:&nbsp;https://x.com/EmanAbio/status/1838597119411929458\nBut for 2025, we’re turning that up to eleven, streamlining everything from how you query on-chain data to how you verify your Move code.\nOur guiding principle? Write less boilerplate, get more done.\nWhether you’re spinning up a DeFi protocol, or tinkering with some AI-fueled dApp, Sui wants you coding features, not wrestling with infrastructure.\nFirst Up, RPC 2.0; A Smarter Way to Query Sui\nWe’re ditching JSON-RPC and going all-in on GraphQL, which pairs perfectly with Sui’s object-centric model.\nThat means fewer endpoint hacks and more natural queries, especially when you’re dealing with complex relationships (like multiple child objects or dynamic NFTs).\nPlus, the RPC service is splitting off from fullnodes.\nMeaning, no more “read vs. write” choke points. Indexers can grab transaction data in bulk, do the heavy lifting, and feed it into a stateless RPC layer that stays snappy even under massive load.\nMeanwhile, the Move Registry is about to turn building on Move into a frictionless, community-driven process.\nNext Is Sui Move Prover\nSecurity is front and center on everyone’s mind, so we’re finally rolling out a developer-friendly formal verification tool.\nlink:https://x.com/b1ackd0g/status/1874531793476497837\nThe Sui Move Prover checks the correctness of your Move code by letting you write specs in plain Move assertions (instead of learning a new spec language).\nThe upside?\nYou can systematically prove code properties without switching mental contexts every five minutes.\nThis is a big step forward for advanced devs who want to guarantee safety in their DeFi protocols or next-gen dApps.\nSpeaking of security, Sui isn’t stopping at static analysis.\nThen Comes Bugdar; The AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditing Tool\nBugdar is an AI-driven scanning system that pounces on potential vulnerabilities before they ever see the light of mainnet.\nBuilt using an ensemble of frontier LLMs (like o1, Gemini, and Claude), Bugdar runs in real-time, so you can catch issues in your code from day one.\nIt’s like having a security researcher embedded in your IDE, constantly checking for reentrancy traps or funky code patterns.\nAnd because it’s trained on real exploit scenarios, it can spot subtle threats that might slip past conventional audits.\nWe’re Also Rolling Out Move Registry\nMove Registry acts like a universal naming service for packages and modules.\nSimilar to how NPM or&nbsp;crates.io&nbsp;changed the game for JavaScript and Rust, the Move Registry ensures you don’t need to memorize cryptic addresses every time you want to import someone else’s code.\nJust reference human-readable package names and let the registry resolve everything for you.\nWhether you’re building PTBs, referencing another dev’s on-chain library, or handling cross-project dependencies, the Move Registry cuts the overhead so you can actually focus on shipping.\nThink fewer headaches, fewer collisions, and a smoother path to code reuse.\nWe want Sui devs to borrow and share code as easily as they do on Web2 platforms.\nSpeaking of making this easy for developers: we’re rolling out new SDKs to ensure that building on Sui is a matter of writing a few lines of code, not wrestling with complicated zero-knowledge circuits.\nCode Less, Ship Faster; Let the SDKs Do the Heavy Lifting\nA lot of people ask, “How do I actually build a Web3 app without hiring a dozen cryptographers?”\nThe answer: SDKs that let you tap into Sui’s power in just a few lines of code, no advanced crypto wizardry required.\nWe’ve been working hand-in-hand with devs to figure out what exactly needs to be packaged up: from basic transaction calls to advanced zero-knowledge hooks.\nAnd because Sui’s architecture treats each asset as an object, once you have a well-structured SDK, mixing and matching functionality is a breeze.\nBy bundling up core Sui functionality into straightforward APIs, be they JavaScript, Python, or Move-based DSLs, we’re reducing the friction that used to slow down project timelines.\nNo more fumbling with half-documented endpoints or rewriting the same transaction logic from scratch.\nYou just import, configure, and start building.\nPut it all together, and you’ve got a dev workflow that’s faster and more secure than ever.\nBut as we keep streamlining life for developers, we also want to make sure everyday users enjoy the same level of frictionless experience.\nSo, Devs Are Happy; Now Let’s Remove the Last Bit of Friction for the Users\nOne of our biggest pushes in 2025 is making Sui feel invisible to the average person.\nThat’s why we’re bringing together all the major breakthroughs under a single banner: frictionless user experience.\nNext-Gen Passkeys\nPasskeys are shaping up to be a game-changer for day-to-day usage, bridging biometrics and ephemeral session keys so you don’t need to sign over and over.\nImagine unlocking your DeFi swap with Face ID, then playing a Sui-based game without reauthorizing every action.\nWe’re also experimenting with ephemeral keys that automatically disappear once you’re done, meaning you never leave behind any “digital residue.”\nIt’s about giving you the speed of Web2 apps, plus the trust-minimized security of Web3, all in one flow.\nBut, even with Passkeys, people lose devices, forget passwords, or want a fallback plan for disaster scenarios. That’s where KELP comes in.\nKELP: The “Safety Net” That Feels Like Magic\nThink of KELP as your personal safety net for Sui accounts: you can set up flexible recoveries, attach 2FA logic, or even pair it with zkLogin as a backup login method.\nKELP offers a smart layer of recovery logic, combining 2FA, fallback mechanisms, and even zkLogin for extra assurance.\nWant to set up a scenario where Google sign-in stands in as your backup if you forget your mnemonic? Done. Want to tie your recovery to your Facebook or an additional passkey device? KELP has you covered.\nlink:&nbsp;https://x.com/kostascrypto/status/1859694527738446191\nNo more horror stories of lost seed phrases. KELP means you always have a path back to your account, minus the tears.\nFor power users and institutions, we’re taking things a notch further with multi-factor wallets. By weaving in hardware enclaves, multi-sig logic, and advanced key-loss protection from KELP, you get a flexible safety net. It’s enough to satisfy both self-sovereignty purists and those who prefer a guardian to bail them out in worst-case scenarios.\nYou can pick your level of custody: pure self-ownership, or a “shared guardian” approach where a trusted third party can step in if something goes south.\nPut simply, it’s a best-of-both-worlds model that ensures you won’t lose sleep (or your assets) if you misplace a key. Now, with all the infrastructure and user-friendly features we have built for Sui, it has reached a point where interacting with Sui doesn’t feel “crypto-like” at all.\nIt’s just fast, safe, and user-friendly.\nThis sets the stage for the next big wave: gaming.\nWe’ve Nailed UX; This Year Gaming Will Bring Sui to the Masses\nWe used to hear that Web3 was too confusing, too slow, or too niche. But in 2025, we’re flipping the script with the&nbsp;@SuiPlay&nbsp;device and&nbsp;@PLAYTR0N&nbsp;OS.\nGaming is Sui's trojan horse for mass adoption.\nInstead of forcing players into obscure wallets or complex sign-ins, it layers blockchain right into the gaming experience at the OS level.\nNo friction, no weird fees or toggles, just pure gameplay that taps into Sui’s real-time asset trading behind the scenes.\nIn 2025, you will be able to get your hands on the&nbsp;@SuiPlay&nbsp;devices that you have ordered.&nbsp;Behind the scenes, we’ve lined up big-name studios and major titles: think&nbsp;@panzerdogs,&nbsp;@playDARKTIMES,&nbsp;@xocietyofficial&nbsp;,@samuraishodown, plus more.\nWe’re not just talking about a handful of indie experiments.\nOver 65 studios are already building for Sui, with around 70 titles queued up for 2025 releases.\nThat’s how you spark a user explosion, thousands of gamers jumping into frictionless experiences without the usual wallet nightmares.\nYou want to sell a legendary sword mid-raid, buy an armor upgrade instantly, or swap NFTs with someone halfway across the world? Done in under a second\nAnd that’s exactly how we bridge the gap between “on-chain assets” and the frantic reality of in-game action.\nThen they start discovering the broader Sui ecosystem: maybe they convert their in-game gold into stablecoins, or stake it in a DeFi protocol.\nSuddenly, you’ve got millions of new entrants in DeFi who never thought of themselves as “blockchain users.”\nA single top-tier title can bring millions of active users who log in daily, and all those microtransactions flow into liquidity protocols, token markets, stablecoin swaps, you name it.\nAnd which protocol could run most of this trading activity? Think&nbsp;@DeepBookonSui.\nWhen a player trades, they're actually using DeepBook, Sui's fully on-chain order book capable of delivering a trading experience similar to that of a CEX.\nThe beauty is that gamers won’t even realize they’re doing DeFi until they see the results: cheaper fees, real asset ownership, unstoppable markets.\nThat’s when you get mainstream adoption, when the underlying tech stops being a barrier and becomes a gateway to more vibrant digital economies.\nThat exact same, near-invisible blockchain experience that can win over gamers also speaks volumes to traditional institutions.\nWith Sui, they see a platform that can scale globally, handle real-money transactions, and keep everything simple for the end user.\nNext Up Is a RealFi Revolution; And We’re Just Getting Started\nIn 2024, the Sui ecosystem made waves by pushing its Total Value Locked in DeFi well past $1.75 billion.\nThat was a wake-up call for more than just crypto traders.\nWhat’s coming in 2025, however, goes far beyond crypto speculation and yield farming.\nPartnerships like the one with Ant Digital will result in the inflow of billions in fixed-income assets directly onto Sui.\nThat means an investor in Hong Kong can own a slice of a bond originated in Europe without cutting through layers of middlemen.\nWe’re already seeing stablecoin liquidity (USDC, FDUSD, and more) feed into this, along with cross-chain BTC integration from Lombard Finance.\nOn the retail side, think “wallet as a bank account” for people who’ve been shut out of legacy finance.\nInstead of fighting cross-border wires or currency instability, they can log in with zkLogin, deposit (or receive remittances) instantly, and hold assets in digital form without local bank hoops.\nThat’s a complete game-changer for countries where opening a checking account is more painful than pulling teeth.\nThe result is a robust, interconnected network that feels less like a crypto playground and more like the global financial system 2.0, only cheaper, faster, and transparent by design. Once you open the door to real assets you're going to need trading infrastructure that can handle the rush without glitching.\nThat’s where DeepBook becomes a force multiplier.\nHere, DeepBook becomes a global central limit order book for literally any asset you can tokenize, providing sub-second swaps and full transparency.\nNo gatekeepers, no clunky order handling, just a smooth, unstoppable engine that ties into DeFi’s massive liquidity.\nInstitutions see that and realize “on-chain” no longer means “slow or risky”; it’s an upgrade from siloed, aging financial pipelines.\nAnd because Sui hammered out user friction last year, 2025 will see Sui welcoming an influx of institutional volume that was previously waiting on a reliable, low-latency L1.\nThe logical next phase?\nExtending that same powerhouse infrastructure to become a global coordination layer for every corner of the digital economy.\nAnd Finally, This Is the Year Where Sui's Arc as a Global Coordination Layer Really Begins\nThe core idea of Sui has always been to be more than just a “faster, cheaper blockchain.”\nFrom day one, Sui was designed to solve a fundamental challenge: coordinating human activity across distance and time, without handing all power to a centralized middleman.\nBy 2025, we’re finally seeing that vision play out at scale.\nInstead of a loose collection of siloed dApps, Sui is evolving into a global coordination layer for digital assets, connecting everything from cross-chain liquidity to 3D printing supply chains.\nCoordinating Cross-Chain Assets with IKA\nFor Sui, “Global Coordination Layer” isn’t a tagline, it’s the logical endgame.\nOnce you realize Sui can manage complex digital assets, off-chain infrastructure, and cross-chain liquidity all in one place. You see how Sui can become the natural underlying fabric.\nFor anything that requires people or machines to converge on a single source of truth.\nThe proof is in the projects already leading the charge.\nImagine controlling your Ethereum or Solana assets straight from a Sui-based contract, but with zero reliance on the usual bridging headaches.\nThat’s what IKA brings to the table.\nIt’s a system that allows Sui-based smart contracts to sign transactions on other chains, thanks to distributed MPC signers and two-party computations (2PC).\nThere’s no single “bridge” holding all the keys.\nInstead, each user remains an essential participant, so even if half the network turned rogue, your tokens wouldn’t magically vanish.\nThis changes cross-chain interactions from a fragile patchwork of solutions into a secure, user-centric model of true interoperability.\nSuddenly, Sui becomes the universal ledger coordinating different networks, turning multi-chain complexity into something you can manage with a few lines of Move code.\n3DOS: Rebooting Manufacturing Logistics\nThen there’s 3DOS, a platform that coordinates global manufacturing via 3D printing networks.\nThey’re swapping out old-school supply chains for real-time, on-demand production, all governed by Sui’s unstoppable finality and minimal transaction friction.\nYou push a button, the system routes your request to the nearest idle 3D printer, and the item materializes, no warehouses, no half-baked logistics nightmares.\nMeanwhile, Walrus ties it all together by offering a way to store massive data on-chain in a decentralized, composable manner.\nIt lets you store and retrieve data in a decentralized fashion, enabling you to build an entire off-chain solution, like a big 3D-printing pipeline or a supply-chain aggregator.\nAt the same time, you can rely on Sui’s consensus to coordinate who stores what, for how long, and at what price.\nNow, imagine those same protocols powered by AI agents that can autonomously transact, verify, and reason about the data they process.\nThat’s where 2025 will really get exciting.\nWe Broke Down Every Barrier; AI Agents Are the Last Piece of the Puzzle\nIMO, 2025 will be the year where we finally cross over from AI living in back-end servers.\nAI will start living in front of our eyes, right in the thick of human interactions, social feeds, and on-chain transactions.\nWhat makes these agents truly revolutionary is their ability to act with minimal human oversight while tapping into real money flows and services around the globe.\nIn practice, that means an agent you spin up to handle project management could instantly spin off a second agent specialized in web design. It could pay for its deliverables autonomously.\nFinally, it could merge the results into a final package with no human micromanagement needed.\nThe challenge is making sure these agents can trust each other’s identities, run on verified code, and interact with real data without leaking private information.\nThat’s where Sui comes in.\nBy easily giving each agent a crypto wallet (zkLogin), Sui can remove the hassle of credit cards and bank accounts, letting them transact directly in digital currency. And because Sui is cheap and fast, microtransactions or frequent data updates don’t choke the system or blow up the budget. Meanwhile, features like attestation ensure an agent you hired for, say, code review is actually running the correct LLM model, not some hacked or backdoored version.\nOn top of that, you can store large data sets or entire AI models privately in Walrus, letting agents share and consume data without risking unauthorized leaks.\nAdd in Sui’s emerging DRM-like capabilities, which ensure your data or content is delivered exactly as you intend. It remains encrypted at rest and is protected by the chain of trust.\nThe result is a perfect sandbox for building next-level AI Agent-to-Agent coordination.\nThis is how we’ll see entire agent ecosystems emerge in 2025.\nWe’re already seeing early AI dev platforms like&nbsp;@Atoma_Network&nbsp;building on Sui.\nIMO, we will soon see AI agents that can read, write, execute, and pay for services at scale with sub-second finality.\nThat’s not a pipe dream anymore; it’s the next logical step.\nIt’s the start of a whole new era, and we’ve barely scratched the surface of where these autonomous agents can go.\nWe’ve Built the Perfect Foundation; Now Let’s Take Sui Mainstream\nSui started out by blowing past old limits on speed and throughput, but in 2025, you’ll see that was just the opening act.\nLooking back at how far Sui has come, it’s obvious Sui has outgrown the old narrative of “just another L1.”\nSui’s technology stack is finally hitting a point where even the biggest skeptics can’t ignore what’s been built.\nNow, the only step left is to make the entire process of building on Sui as straightforward and inviting as possible. Our aim is simple: if you’ve got a bold idea for a Web3 app, Sui should be your first choice. Not because of hype or marketing, but because it’s undeniably the smoothest path to success.\nWe want Sui to be the bedrock of everything digital in 2025, and that means making Sui the easiest platform developers have ever touched.\nComments by Steve Kim\nEven the achievements Sui made in 2023-2024 were things that existing Layer 1s could never accomplish (zk-Login, Mysticeti, Stashed, Dynamic NFT, Deepbook, suiNS, SuiPlay0X1), and the initiatives lined up for 2025 are truly remarkable to the point of being astounding. What's particularly bullish is that protocols like Sui-Walrus-Deepbook-SCION aren't operating independently, but are deeply intertwined throughout the 2025 roadmap, showing very tight relationships. This explains why Deepbook has been receiving constant attention.

      "content": "Move Fast and Build Things: The Sui Suite of Innovations\nThesisPortfolioAbout\nTeamNode.MonsterBlog\n\nContact\n\nMove Fast and Build Things: The Sui Suite of Innovations\nSynergy in Motion\nOr Harel\n\nApril 25, 2025\n\nIntroduction\nWhen trying to sift through the hyperbolic Crypto Twitter for the next \"crypto gem\" or \"killer app\", common narratives persist: projects market themselves as the fastest, the most decentralized, or the newest AI Agents protocol on the block. While these features may signal technical sophistication, they rarely drive lasting adoption when pursued in isolation. A blockchain can be orders of magnitude faster than its peers, but without meaningful usage, it's just another meaningless benchmark. Privacy and decentralization matter—but only when they're violated. Most users will choose convenience over ideology, until the next CEX implosion, or until a supposedly private service—perhaps one dealing in sensitive personal affairs—is hacked, making users' digital histories devastatingly public.\nThe personal computer didn't transform society due to sheer processing speed, but through the convergence of hardware, software, interface design, and ecosystem development. Similarly, the internet's power came not from raw bandwidth, but from the interplay of protocols, applications, and clear, enjoyable UX. Persistent adoption tends to follow a different formula: performance that meets application demands, development frameworks that enable innovation, user experiences that remove friction, and economic designs that align incentives. That's a quality stack. Not one thing done ten times better—but a comprehensive, well-rounded approach. Long-term innovation necessitates first-principled long-term thinking, while being flexible and agile. You don't want merely the cheapest or fastest surgeon but a reliable one that can adapt to changes and is ready when it matters most.\nSui (pronounced \"Swee\") is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain developed by Mysten Labs, founded by former Meta engineers who previously developed the Move programming language and Diem blockchain. Rather than staking its identity on one feature, Sui distinguishes itself by integrating scalability, safety, usability, and composability into a unified design. Its object-centric model and parallel execution engine deliver high throughput for demanding applications. The Move programming language enforces stricter safety at the smart contract level. DeepBook, a native CLOB, introduces traditional market structure into DeFi. And with zkLogin and sponsored transactions, Sui strives to make onboarding as seamless as any Web2 experience.\n10x, But No 10x\nIn this fast-moving terrain—accelerated now by AI tools that can prototype and deploy faster than ever—traditional \"moats\" are looking increasingly two-dimensional. A single feature is no longer a lasting defense. We're entering a three-dimensional era of swarm innovation, where AI-powered applications behave like drones—flying over conventional barriers, landing directly where users need them, and quickly reshaping product expectations. Much like how future warfare is predicted to shift from human-centered combat to autonomous drone swarms operating in concert, crypto innovation is evolving toward multilayered, adaptive systems that can outmaneuver static defenses through coordinated, multi-vector approaches. Move fast, or fade into obscurity.\nIn such an environment, even the deepest moat can become irrelevant. Strategic edge no longer comes from holding one strong position, but from navigating across multiple dimensions at once. And while nothing is guaranteed in this space, Sui demonstrates how infrastructure, user experience, economics, and ecosystem coordination evolve in parallel. Their developer-first approach enables faster, more intuitive building experiences that dramatically reduce time-to-market for complex applications. Not by doing one thing 10x better—but by doing many critical things right, simultaneously achieving excellence across multiple fronts—everything, everywhere, all at once.\n‍\n\nAt a Glance\nCore Philosophy and Architecture\nIntroduction\n10x, But No 10x\nAn Architecture for Success\nDesigning Out Errors: The Preventative Power of Move\nEcosystem and Development Focus\nBuilding for Builders\nProjects Driving Innovation: Two Squids, a Walrus, and a Whale Walk into a Bar\nBuilders on Sui: Enabling New Capabilities\nTop Ecosystem Projects\n\nUse Cases and Market Segments\nWell-Suited for Fun and Games\nCeFi-Like DeFi For the Retail and TradiFi\nBabylon and Lombard Join Sui Ecosystem\nUser Experience Innovations\nSui UI: Web2 Experience for Web3\nWallet Infrastructure\nzkLogin: A Key for Seamless Onboarding\nGas Abstraction and Sui Name Service\n\nFoundations and Validation\nLeadership and Institutional Backing\nExecutive Team &amp; Technical Expertise\nInstitutional Capital &amp; Investment Rounds\nBuilding with Institutions: Momentum and Collaboration\n\nOutlook and Positioning\nThe Competitive Landscape\nTokenomics and Community Engagement\nFuture Growth Vectors\nConclusion: More Than the Sum of Its Parts\n\n‍\nAn Architecture for Success\nUnlike traditional blockchains that evolved through incremental improvements to existing designs, Sui was architected from first principles to address the fundamental limitations that have constrained blockchain adoption. This approach is evident in three core architectural choices that together form the foundation of Sui's technical advantage.\nSui's innovative architecture features the Move Language for enhanced security and developer accessibility through its object-oriented design; Parallel Transaction Execution to dramatically increase throughput by processing independent transactions simultaneously; and DAG-Based Consensus (Mysticeti) using a leaderless graph structure for ultra-fast finality and reduced latency. These core elements are complemented by key innovations like MEV Resistance via parallel execution and deterministic ordering to minimize manipulation; DeepBook, a built-in Central Limit Order Book for efficient DeFi liquidity; Sponsored Transactions &amp; Gas Stations enabling applications to cover user gas fees for a seamless experience; an Advanced Scalability approach combining vertical and exploring horizontal scaling; and Kiosk, a decentralized commerce primitive allowing creators to enforce custom policies like royalties on asset trades.\nDesigning Out Errors: The Preventative Power of Move\nAt the heart of Sui's architecture is the Move programming language, purpose-built for blockchain environments where asset safety and ownership are paramount. Created specifically because existing languages were insufficient for the complexities of blockchain programming, Move was developed by a team led by Adeniyi Abiodun, who brought extensive expertise in programming language design from his work at Meta. Move's object-centric model treats digital assets as native objects with built-in ownership rules, fundamentally changing how developers approach smart contract security. Rather than retrofitting security onto inherently vulnerable systems, Move embeds security directly in its language architecture, making common vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks, integer overflows, and phantom asset creation structurally difficult or impossible to introduce. This isn't merely a developer convenience—it's a foundational shift that reduces the attack surface available to potential exploiters and enables formal verification of critical code paths, allowing developers to mathematically prove the correctness of their contracts.\nComplementing Move's security focus is Sui's parallel transaction execution model, which fundamentally breaks the traditional blockchain paradigm of processing transactions sequentially. By allowing independent transactions to execute simultaneously, Sui achieves throughput levels that were mathematically impossible in traditional blockchain designs. The recent Mysticeti consensus upgrade refined this approach, enabling approximately 400ms finality—less than a quarter of Solana's 2-3 second finality (5-7.5x slower) and dramatically faster than Ethereum's current 15-minute finality time (with plans for \"Single slot finality\"). This parallel execution model consistently achieves 200,000 transactions per second (TPS) in testing environments, with the capability to scale to 400,000 TPS albeit when operating with 50 validator nodes. For applications where transaction confirmation directly impacts user experience, like gaming or financial trading, this performance differential transforms what's possible within the blockchain environment.\nA fundamental innovation in Sui's design lies in its approach to scalability. While many Layer 1 blockchains focus on vertical scaling—maximizing the performance of individual validators—Sui employs horizontal scaling designed for elasticity of both supply and demand. This architectural choice means that increased activity in one application doesn't negatively impact performance or costs for others on the network. As co-founder Adeniyi Abiodun explains, other blockchains often “penalize success” through surge pricing, where a popular game or DeFi app drives up gas fees for everyone. On Sui, one application's success doesn't hurt the entire ecosystem.\" In practice, this means that when a game like Panzerdogs experiences a surge in players, it doesn't cause gas fees to spike across all Sui applications—unlike on Ethereum or increasingly on Solana during periods of high demand. This is not a bolt-on solution but a core architectural advantage that becomes increasingly valuable as the network grows.\nThe synergy between these architectural elements has proven particularly powerful. Move's object-based model integrates seamlessly with Sui's parallel execution, creating a system that's simultaneously more secure and more performant than competitors that excel in only one dimension. This integration is especially powerful for complex applications like games, where asset ownership and real-time interaction must coexist with robust security. The horizontal scaling approach ensures this performance remains consistent even as the network expands, avoiding the degradation that has plagued other high-growth blockchains. Together, these architectural choices don't just solve individual blockchain limitations—they create a foundation capable of supporting the next generation of decentralized applications.\nBuilding for Builders\nA blockchain is ultimately only as valuable as the applications built upon it. Recognizing this, Sui has adopted a developer-first approach as a core design principle, creating an environment where innovation can flourish with reduced friction and enhanced productivity. This strong focus on developers from the outset is yielding results, evident in both quantitative metrics and qualitative developer feedback.\nSui CPO Adeniyi Abiodun emphasizes that \"we started our journey feeling like ultimately we can't just follow the playbook of other chains. We knew if we were really obsessive about the developer experience we'd win - that's really it. So we very much over-indexed on developer experience from day one.\" This developer-centric philosophy has shaped Sui from its inception, with engineers at Mysten Labs committed to \"building the best platform that developers can use on a daily basis and feel really proud about what they develop.\"\nThe vision extends beyond the current Web3 paradigm, as Abiodun explains: \"Our goal is not just web three - our goal is to win over the mass majority of the internet. We're building a decentralized stack for coordinating internet interactions while everyone else is just building chains. We can do chains better than everyone else, but the extra step in building a platform for all developers is an area where I think we could really excel more than anyone else in the market.\" This holistic approach, according to Abiodun, positions Sui as \"the most powerful developer platform for internet 3.0 where every developer now has the ability to offer their products and services in a new decentralized way without having middlemen or brokers in the middle.\"\nThe most immediate advantage for developers comes through Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs), which revolutionize how developers interact with blockchain infrastructure. PTBs allow developers to treat smart contracts effectively as APIs, enabling the construction of complex interactions between multiple assets or contracts using traditional programming languages like Rust or C++. With PTBs, developers can essentially orchestrate sophisticated multi-step transactions without writing intricate smart contracts.\nFor example, a developer could use PTBs to create a game marketplace where players can simultaneously list multiple game items, convert proceeds to stablecoins, and stake a portion—all in a single atomic transaction using familiar programming patterns rather than complex smart contract orchestration. This dramatically reduces development complexity and time: one gaming studio reported completing their marketplace integration in three days instead of the projected three weeks. This efficiency gain isn't marginal—it represents an order of magnitude improvement in development velocity that enables rapid iteration and experimentation.\nPTBs also enable permissionless composability, where developers can build upon existing applications without requiring approval or custom integration. This creates powerful network effects where each new application increases the utility of the entire ecosystem. The ability to seamlessly combine multiple contract interactions not only accelerates development but opens possibilities for entirely new application categories that would be impractically complex to build on traditional blockchain architectures.\nThis developer-friendly approach has catalyzed remarkable ecosystem growth. Core developer participation has grown from just 5 in early 2022 to a peak of 84 in January 2024—a 16.8x increase that outpaces the growth rates of competing Layer 1 protocols at similar developmental stages. The broader developer ecosystem shows even more dramatic expansion, with monthly active developers surging from 13 at launch to a peak of 892, demonstrating strong belief in the platform's long-term viability among those with the technical expertise to evaluate it critically.\nThe strength of Sui's ecosystem is further evidenced by its robust developer and community engagement throughout 2024. The Sui Basecamp 2024 event demonstrated significant global reach, attracting over 1,100 participants from 65 countries and featuring 100 speakers. The Sui Overflow Hackathon drew more than 2,000 participants from over 75 countries and generated 352 project submissions—with 32 winning projects selected—numbers that rival the largest hackathons in the blockchain space. This impressive momentum continued at the Builder House Singapore event, which gathered over 2,400 attendees and featured key ecosystem developments such as the Walrus Whitepaper and the strategic USDC integration announcement.\nProjects Driving Innovation: Two Squids, a Walrus, and a Whale Walk into a Bar\nBeyond the core protocol, Sui's architecture is empowering projects and protocols to build novel solutions that enable entirely new capabilities within the ecosystem.\nBuilders on Sui: Enabling New Capabilities\nInnovative dApps and infrastructure solutions are recognizing Sui's architectural advantages and building experiences made possible only by its unique design. Ika (squid in Japanese) chose Sui for its trustless cross-chain interoperability solution, implementing a novel cryptographic scheme called 2PC-MPC (Two-Party Computation Multi-Party Computation). This approach creates a new primitive called the dWallet, which enables Sui smart contract developers to control assets across multiple blockchains without traditional bridge vulnerabilities. Ika leverages Sui as its coordination layer, where its IKA token and staking mechanisms reside, while using the platform's unique object-centric data model to implement complex functionalities like multi-chain custody and trustless account transfers (sending an entire wallet to another user).\n\nIka: Unlocking parallel MPC breakthroughs through Sui's distinctive architecture.When selecting a blockchain foundation, Ika's technical requirements for latency, throughput, and decentralization eliminated all existing networks except Sui. According to their team, implementing their cryptographic breakthroughs on any other platform \"just wouldn't work\" and would \"completely destroy all of the breakthroughs\" in their fast cryptography implementation. One of the most compelling applications is native Bitcoin programmability on Sui, where users can keep their Bitcoin in a dWallet and enforce logic on it through Sui smart contracts without moving it off the Bitcoin network or creating a derivative. This enables lending and borrowing against native BTC without the added security risks, regulatory complexities, and tax consequences of wrapped Bitcoin—addressing a major capital inefficiency in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Sui's performance enables Ika to achieve sub-second speeds while scaling to 10,000 signatures per second with hundreds of signer nodes—all while maintaining zero-trust security.\nAddressing sophisticated financial needs requires a blockchain capable of supporting complex, secure, and highly performant on-chain logic – a vision that Aeon is pursuing. Aeon is developing an MPC wallet designed for funds, treasuries, and DeFi investors, enabling automated operations, yield optimization, and risk mitigation across more than 30 chains. This platform aims to blend the seamless usability of Web2 platforms with the unparalleled security and decentralized assurances inherent to Web3 infrastructure. Crucially, Aeon's team highlights that achieving this vision is only possible on Sui, leveraging it as a robust coordination layer that provides the essential security, scalability, and flexibility needed for institutional-grade custody solutions.\nSui's distinct computational model and the Move programming language are integral to Aeon's secure infrastructure strategy. Aeon's entire business logic lives on-chain on Sui, supporting complex features like user permissions, transaction voting, and a sophisticated policy engine. This is made possible by features like Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTBs), which Aeon leverages to chain together over 150 function calls in a single, complex transaction—a feat not easily replicated on traditional EVM networks. Furthermore, Move's unique patterns, such as the hot potato pattern for permissionless chain integrations and the capability pattern for strict access control, provide foundational building blocks essential for Aeon's broad chain support and enhanced security posture. Combined with user-friendly features enabled by Sui like zkLogin and gas sponsoring, these technical capabilities allow Aeon to deliver an institutional-grade, yet intuitive, multi-chain asset management platform that the team believes is uniquely possible on Sui.\nTop Ecosystem Projects\nProminent projects across key verticals are also choosing Sui due to its performance and developer-friendly environment. Among these, Walrus stands out as a decentralized storage and data availability protocol built on Sui, designed to handle large binary files like videos, images, and AI datasets with high efficiency and reliability. Leveraging advanced erasure coding for resilience, Walrus integrates tightly with Sui for coordination and payments, allowing developers to offload unstructured data storage and enabling programmable interactions with stored data. Its economic model includes burning SUI tokens, creating deflationary pressure. Launched in March 2025 with $140 million in backing and a $2 billion fully diluted valuation, Walrus has demonstrated strong performance, processing 5 million blobs (27.85TB) during its testnet phase. It serves as a critical storage layer for Sui's history and dApps, positioning Sui as a key player in decentralized storage for data-intensive applications like AI, gaming, and DeFi by bridging Web2 and Web3 storage paradigms.\nIn decentralized finance, Suilend has quickly emerged as a leading lending protocol on Sui. Built by the team behind Solend, a prominent lending protocol on Solana, Suilend brings proven expertise in DeFi application development to the Sui ecosystem, establishing a robust platform for lending and borrowing activities. Beyond lending protocols like Suilend, Scallop, and Navi, Sui's DeFi landscape is home to other significant protocols such as Cetus for decentralized exchange and Bluefin for perpetuals trading, collectively contributing to a vibrant and comprehensive financial ecosystem.\n\nAxelar, a leading Web3 interoperability platform connecting over 69 blockchains ($10B+ transferred across 2.5M+ transactions), and Squid, a decentralized finance router protocol ($1.5B routed through 900K transactions for 350K users), have also integrated with Sui to enhance its cross-chain capabilities. Axelar brings General Message Passing functionality to Sui, enabling seamless asset transfers and smart contract interactions across chains, while Squid builds on this foundation to facilitate efficient cross-chain token swaps and liquidity in under 20 seconds. In their \"Path Towards an Interoperable Future\" discussion, both protocols highlighted Sui's differentiation from standard EVM chains, Move's well-structured design, and the advantages of Deep Book, Sui's on-chain order book.\nSui's object-centric data model provides another substantial advantage for developers building complex applications. This model offers a natural mapping for concepts like game assets, NFTs, and financial instruments, which are often hierarchical and composable. By aligning the blockchain's native data structures with the conceptual models developers already use, Sui reduces the cognitive overhead required to translate between application logic and blockchain capabilities. This alignment is particularly valuable in gaming applications, where the ability to model complex asset relationships directly impacts gameplay possibilities.\nThe ecosystem's tool development further enhances the developer experience. Services like Enoki provide API access to Sui without requiring smart contract development, allowing for easier onboarding and features like gas abstraction or naming services. The Sui SDK offers comprehensive libraries for multiple languages, while the Sui Explorer provides enhanced visibility into network activities. These tools collectively reduce the specialized knowledge required to build on Sui, broadening the pool of potential developers beyond blockchain specialists to include mainstream software engineers.\nUnlike some blockchain platforms that excel primarily in DeFi or \"MemeFi\", Sui has attracted developers across gaming, social applications, infrastructure tools, and financial services. This breadth demonstrates Sui's capacity to foster innovation across multiple domains simultaneously—a critical factor for long-term ecosystem vitality. As the ecosystem expands, this diverse foundation acts as a rising tide that lifts all participants, creating network effects that benefit developers across all sectors. If/When the \"SUInami\" comes—that moment of explosive adoption and growth—it will be this broad-based foundation that provides stability and continued momentum across the entire ecosystem.\nWell-Suited for Fun and Games\nWhile DeFi has been a primary focus in the blockchain space, the Sui team places significant emphasis on gaming as a critical vertical for driving mainstream Web3 adoption. With 3.3 billion gamers worldwide and a global market valued at $241.1 billion in 2024, gaming represents a massive opportunity for bringing users into Web3. As highlighted by Sui's founders in the 'Sui Masterclass', the scale of this market is immense, generating \"more than movies more than music as a whole,\" and they believe \"gaming is huge and we think it's going to be the biggest adoption curve for Web3\".\nRecognizing that complexities like cumbersome wallets and unpredictable gas fees have created poor experiences in early Web3 games, Sui is engineered to overcome these barriers. The platform's technical architecture, including its object-centric data model and high performance, along with features like seamless user onboarding via zkLogin and sponsored transactions, provide developers with the tools needed to build truly engaging games and offer players genuine ownership and influence. This focus on delivering a superior user experience aligns with the team's broader mission. As Evan Cheng, CEO and co-founder of Mysten Labs, stated, \"Our mission is to bring the advantages of Web3 to billions. Creating products that genuinely attract user volume is our foremost priority.\" This commitment to user-centric design and leveraging Sui's unique capabilities positions gaming as a key driver for Sui's growth.\nThe gaming ecosystem on Sui has demonstrated extraordinary growth metrics, with daily transactions increasing from just 13,300 in January 2024 to 433,700 by December—a 32.5x surge in activity within a single year. Even more impressive is the growth in daily active users, which climbed from 2,400 to 195,800 during the same period—an 81.7x increase that suggests the emergence of genuinely engaging experiences rather than speculative token farming. This robust user engagement validates Sui's technical advantages for gaming applications: the 400ms finality enables real-time gameplay feedback, the object-centric data model naturally represents game assets and states, and the horizontal scaling approach prevents popular games from negatively impacting network performance.\nThe ecosystem's depth extends beyond metrics to include substantial studio participation, with 65 gaming studios now building on Sui and approximately 70 titles scheduled for release throughout 2025. These include established developers like Lucky Kat Studios (Panzerdogs), Blowfish Studios (DARKTIMES), and XOCIETY, who bring professional game development expertise rather than simply blockchain tokenomics. Unlike many previous \"blockchain gaming\" initiatives that prioritized financial incentives over gameplay, this new wave of development appears focused on creating compelling experiences that integrate blockchain functionality where it adds genuine value. They are building games first and blockchain second—the technology should enhance the fun, not be the reason people play. This gameplay-first approach represents a maturation of the blockchain gaming space and is more likely to attract mainstream gamers who care about entertainment value rather than tokenomics.\nUnderscoring its commitment to revolutionizing gaming, Mysten Labs is developing SuiPlay0X1, a dedicated gaming console envisioned as a next-generation gaming operating system. This ambitious project aims to bridge the gap between traditional Web2 games from various platforms, including Steam and Epic, alongside native Web3 games, all within a single device. By deeply integrating Sui at the operating system level, SuiPlay0X1 will offer seamless access to on-chain assets and functionalities, potentially featuring ZK login for easy account creation and NFT-based rewards for gameplay.&nbsp;\n\nSource: Sui Network’s X postThis initiative represents a bold step towards making blockchain technology an integral and user-friendly component of the mainstream gaming experience. As Evan Cheng describes it, SuiPlay0X1 is a gaming operating system that lets users play both traditional games and blockchain games on a single device, creating a seamless bridge between gaming paradigms. By creating dedicated hardware optimized for blockchain gaming, Sui positions itself not just as another platform for game developers, but as a potential category leader in an emerging gaming paradigm. The strategic timing and location of the Sui Gaming Summit alongside the mainstream Game Developers Conference further emphasizes this ambition to participate in the broader gaming conversation rather than remain isolated in a blockchain-specific niche.\nBeyond gaming, Sui's architecture enables other non-financial applications that benefit from its unique capabilities. The object-centric data model proves particularly valuable for NFT applications, with platforms like BlueMove leveraging Sui's Kiosk primitive to create decentralized marketplaces with native royalty enforcement and transfer restrictions. Kiosk is a decentralized commerce primitive that allows creators to enforce custom policies like royalties on asset trades while retaining asset custody until sale. Unlike NFT implementations on other blockchains that struggle to enforce creator rights—leading to widespread royalty evasion—Sui's built-in primitives enable powerful ownership mechanisms without compromising decentralization principles. This architectural advantage has attracted numerous creative projects beyond simple collectibles, including music rights management, digital identity solutions, and virtual real estate applications.\nLooking further ahead, Sui's founders have articulated a vision for the platform as a coordination layer for AI agents and decentralized marketplaces. As Adeniyi Abiodun explains, Sui can serve as a decentralized, neutral mechanism for AI agents to communicate and exchange value, creating an infrastructure layer for autonomous systems to interact with high performance and strong security guarantees. The combination of performant infrastructure, native ownership primitives, and user-friendly interfaces creates possibilities for AI-driven applications that can interact securely and efficiently on-chain. This perspective extends Sui's potential utility far beyond current blockchain applications, positioning it as infrastructure for emerging technological paradigms rather than merely an incremental improvement to existing blockchain use cases.\nSui's breadth of use cases highlights its ability to go beyond financial services, addressing a broader range of real-world challenges. From gaming and creative industries to AI-driven applications, Sui demonstrates blockchain's role in everyday applications where utility and enjoyable experiences are at the core. By prioritizing user-centric design and delivering tangible benefits, the network cements its position as a versatile and future-ready blockchain. This broad applicability not only accelerates mainstream adoption but also creates a robust foundation for sustainable growth across multiple domains, placing Sui at the forefront of the next wave of technological innovation while enabling it to weather market cycles and continue growing through multiple use cases simultaneously.\nCeFi-Like DeFi For the Retail and TradiFi\nFinancial applications represent the most mature use case for blockchain technology, yet most platforms have been forced to compromise between decentralization and market efficiency. Sui's approach to financial infrastructure demonstrates its comprehensive design philosophy, creating native solutions for challenges that other blockchains address through limited workarounds.\nThe clearest example of this approach is DeepBook, Sui's native Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) built directly into the protocol layer. While other blockchains typically rely on Automated Market Makers (AMMs) due to performance limitations, DeepBook provides the sophisticated market mechanics that institutional traders expect: price-time priority ordering, maker-taker fee models, and efficient price discovery.\nAMMs were essentially an ingenious compromise developed because legacy blockchain architectures couldn't support proper order books due to performance requirements and offered benefits like passive liquidity provision and execution guarantees in nascent markets. They were an innovative solution for their time, but they have inherent efficiency limitations compared to the CLOB model used in traditional finance. Sui's ground-up design with Move illustrates the classic innovator's dilemma in action—while established blockchains remain constrained by their foundational design choices, Sui's clean-slate approach enabled it to implement sophisticated financial primitives that established platforms struggle to match with patchwork solutions.\nDeepBook addresses several fundamental inefficiencies of AMMs: it eliminates impermanent loss for liquidity providers, enables limit orders that execute at exact prices rather than within price ranges, and significantly reduces slippage for large trades. The integration of this high-performance CLOB at the protocol level creates trading experiences more akin to traditional financial markets while maintaining decentralization principles. For institutional traders accustomed to sophisticated order types and execution strategies, DeepBook removes a critical barrier to blockchain adoption by providing familiar market mechanics rather than requiring adaptation to AMM peculiarities.\nThe practical impact of this architecture is evident in rapid market adoption and impressive metrics. By mid-December 2024, DeepBook approached $1 billion in cumulative trading volume, while overall DEX volumes on Sui expanded from $1.8 billion in September 2024 to $12.4 billion in January 2025—a nearly 600% increase in just four months. As of April 23, 2025, leading DEX Cetus ranks #4 globally by 24-hour trading volume with $186.4M, and #9 globally in 24-hour fee generation with approximately $573.8K in daily fees. In December 2024, it reached as high as #12 among all DEXs globally and #7 by weekly revenue, generating $2.1 million in revenue and $420K in fees. For perspective, the performance of its leading DEX Cetus places Sui on a relatively new Layer 1 in competition with established protocols on Ethereum (July 2015) and Solana (March 2020) that have had years to build liquidity and user bases. These metrics are impressive for a new blockchain and indicate that Sui's financial infrastructure is attracting meaningful economic activity rather than merely speculative interest.\n\nDeFi Llama data from April 23, 2025, indicates Cetus ranked 4th globally by 24-hour trading volume ($186.4M).Sui's financial ecosystem has seen remarkable growth in its stablecoin landscape, evolving from having no native stablecoins at launch to a robust and expanding market. Since the start of 2025, the total stablecoin market cap on Sui has surged dramatically, increasing from $373.74 million on January 1st to $888.8 million as of April 23, 2025—a growth of approximately 138.4%, representing a 2.38x increase.\n\nNotably, USDC holds a dominant position in the Sui stablecoin market, accounting for 73.93% of the total market cap as of April 23, 2025. This dominance is partly due to its impressive recent performance, showing a 63.1% increase in market cap over the past month. Beyond USDC, the ecosystem is supported by other major stablecoin implementations, including Tether's USDT, FDUSD, AUSD, and USDY, which collectively contribute to a comprehensive and growing stablecoin base essential for enabling reliable financial applications on Sui.\n\nLending markets have seen substantial deployment on Sui. As of April 23, 2025, several Sui protocols rank among the leaders by 7-day fee generation. These include Suilend at #7 ($390.5K Fees 7d, $488.5M TVL), Scallop Lend at #8 ($309.0K Fees 7d, $140.4M TVL), and NAVI Lending at #11 ($202.0K Fees 7d, $406.5M TVL). Notably, Suilend ranks #7 globally by both TVL and 7-day fees.\nPerpetuals trading platforms provide essential risk management and leveraged trading capabilities. Bluefin, for instance, demonstrates sophisticated derivatives capabilities, with monthly trading volume increasing from $151 million in October 2023 to an all-time high of $4.8 billion in December 2024, maintaining a robust $4.4 billion in January 2025. This addition completes Sui's core financial services offering, enabling the full spectrum of trading strategies required by active market participants.\n\nDeFi Llama Lending Rankings (Apr 23, 2025) by 7-day fees: Suilend #7 ($390.5K), Scallop #8 ($309.0K), NAVI #11 ($202.0K).This comprehensive infrastructure enables complex financial workflows rather than isolated transactions. The integration of fiat on-ramps and cross-chain bridges further enhances Sui's financial ecosystem. Major providers like MoonPay, Alchemy Pay, and Banxa enable users from over 160 countries to purchase SUI directly using traditional payment methods. Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) facilitates native USDC transfers across eight different chains, creating seamless liquidity flows. These gateways don't merely exist as separate components but function as an integrated system that enables capital to flow efficiently into and throughout the Sui ecosystem.\nA cornerstone of Sui's market position is how it effectively bridges the gap between blockchain capabilities and accessible financial utility. Through Spritzfinance integration, users can load SUI onto digital prepaid Visa cards, enabling direct payment for everyday expenses without cumbersome off-ramping processes. This practical application demonstrates how Sui's financial infrastructure extends beyond trading and lending to address real-world financial needs—a crucial evolutionary step for blockchain technology to achieve mainstream relevance.\nBabylon and Lombard Join Sui Ecosystem\nExpanding its BTCFi ecosystem, Sui has recently integrated with two prominent players in Bitcoin DeFi: Babylon Labs and Lombard Finance. Babylon, a key protocol for Bitcoin staking, has attracted significant value, previously amassing over $4 billion in total value locked (TVL). As of April 2025, this figure was around $2.68 billion, following a planned transition by Lombard Finance. Lombard Finance itself commands a substantial TVL of around $1.81 billion, largely secured on the Bitcoin network.\n\nSource: suipiens.com&nbsp;Babylon's integration with Sui, solidified in April 2025, is highlighted by the team as key to enhancing Sui's security by leveraging Bitcoin's robustness. According to Babylon, their modular Bitcoin staking protocol contributes to securing Sui's consensus layer, allowing Bitcoin holders to stake BTC directly on Sui while maintaining self-custody. This development, which the Babylon team highlights positions Sui to become a “Bitcoin Secured Network”' seeks to unlock Bitcoin's massive liquidity for decentralized finance applications within the Sui ecosystem.\nLombard Finance's expansion on March 5, 2025, brought its liquid-staked Bitcoin token, LBTC, to the Sui blockchain as its first deployment on a non-EVM chain. This move enables Bitcoin holders to mint LBTC on Sui and engage with various DeFi protocols, including lending, trading, and staking, thereby broadening Bitcoin's utility in DeFi and positioning Sui as a growing platform for BTCFi innovation.\nThese strategic integrations underscore Sui's emergence as a significant hub for Bitcoin-based decentralized finance, leveraging the substantial assets and infrastructure of both Babylon and Lombard.\nSui UI: Web2 Experience for Web3\nThe gap between Web2 and Web3 user experiences represents one of the most persistent barriers to mainstream blockchain adoption. Traditional onboarding processes require understanding complex concepts like private keys, seed phrases, and gas fees—creating significant friction that deters all but the most committed users. Achieving intuitive user experiences in Web3 often relies on effectively abstracting away complexities—as highlighted in our analysis. Great UX design is so intuitive that even a four-year-old can instinctively use products like an iPhone. Sui has approached this challenge through a suite of protocol-level innovations designed to make blockchain interactions as intuitive as traditional web applications.\nAs co-founder Evan Cheng bluntly states, \"Wallets are the dumbest thing we've ever built in crypto.\" This candid assessment captures a core philosophical commitment to abstracting away the complexities that have hindered mainstream blockchain adoption. Rather than forcing users to adapt to blockchain's technical peculiarities, Sui has reimagined the entire authentication and transaction experience to align with familiar Web2 patterns.\nWallet Infrastructure\nSui’s wallet ecosystem has achieved significant maturation through strategic integrations with major providers. Recent additions of Phantom and Backpack have brought their substantial user bases to Sui, complementing existing solutions like the native Sui wallet and OKX Wallet. All major wallets support advanced security features, including recent official Ledger hardware wallet integration, and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) solutions through Qredo for institutional-grade security. MetaMask users can also access Sui through the Sui MetaMask Snap, extending compatibility to one of the most widely used EVM wallets.\n\nLedger Live on SuizkLogin: A Key for Seamless Onboarding\nAs highlighted before, zkLogin specifically tackles the authentication challenge. This primitive allows users to access Sui applications using familiar Web2 logins, such as their Google, Facebook, or Twitch accounts, while cryptographically preserving the self-custody principles that make blockchain valuable. Technically implemented as a two-factor authentication scheme requiring both an OAuth credential and a user-managed salt, zkLogin eliminates the need for users to manage complex cryptographic keys or remember mnemonics. This creates an onboarding experience indistinguishable from signing into a traditional web application, while maintaining the security and ownership guarantees of blockchain technology. For mainstream users, this removes perhaps the most significant psychological barrier to blockchain adoption—the fear of losing access to assets through key management mistakes.\n\nSource: Sui Foundation Onboarding Made Simple with zkLoginWhat makes zkLogin particularly powerful is its composability with other Sui primitives. Developers can combine zkLogin with sponsored transactions to create experiences where users can sign in with familiar credentials and immediately begin transacting without needing to acquire tokens for gas fees. This can be further enhanced with multisig capabilities for additional security or with the Sui Name System for human-readable addressing. This layering of user-friendly primitives allows developers to craft increasingly frictionless experiences tailored to specific application needs without sacrificing blockchain's core benefits.\nGas Abstraction and Sui Name Service\nComplementing this authentication simplification is Sui's implementation of sponsored transactions, which addresses the persistent challenge of gas fees. By enabling applications to cover transaction costs on behalf of their users, this feature removes the circular problem where new users need to acquire tokens before they can even begin using a blockchain application. Some Sui applications are taking this concept even further, with the co-founders envisioning future models where users might cover transaction costs by simply watching advertisements or engaging with other familiar monetization approaches. As Evan Cheng explains, \"You might be able to transact just by watching an ad, completely abstracting away the concept of gas fees for casual users.\" This abstraction of blockchain economics allows users to experience the benefits of decentralized applications without first navigating cryptocurrency exchanges or understanding gas markets—significantly lowering the cognitive barriers to entry.\nBuilding upon this foundation, Sui introduces the Sui Native Name Service (SNS) with a powerful subdomain feature. Beyond simply replacing complex wallet addresses with human-readable names, SNS allows users and applications to create subdomains, fostering an intuitive organizational structure. For instance, a user with the top-level name \"Nebuchadnezzar\" could create subdomains like \"savings@nebuchadnezzar\" or \"collectibles@nebuchadnezzar\" for different purposes. This email-like notation extends the usability of Sui names, making it even more familiar for Web2 users and enabling a more organized digital identity within the Sui ecosystem. With over 300,000 names already registered, alongside a growing number of subdomains, SNS is rapidly becoming a core component of the Sui user experience.\nThese user-centric innovations have enabled the development of applications that rival traditional financial services in usability. Projects like Stash demonstrate how Sui can support experiences similar to Venmo or Cash App, allowing users to log in with email or Web2 identities and send money instantly using intuitive identifiers. A typical Stash user experience involves logging in with a Google account via zkLogin, then sending funds to \"snoopdog@stash\" rather than a complex alphanumeric address. The recipient gets a notification and can immediately access their funds without needing to create a traditional crypto wallet or manage keys. This experience is virtually indistinguishable from familiar payment applications, representing a significant evolution from the complex interfaces and workflows that have characterized most blockchain applications, potentially opening the door to users who would never have engaged with traditional cryptocurrency interfaces.\nThe impact of these innovations extends beyond individual applications to the broader ecosystem. By reducing onboarding friction, Sui has enabled exponential growth in active accounts—expanding from 584,000 in June 2023 to 45.3 million by early 2025, a 77.5x increase. The convergence of simplified authentication, abstracted transaction costs, and intuitive naming creates an environment where crypto tech can fade into the background, allowing users to focus on the value and utility of applications rather than the underlying infrastructure. This may be the most important step toward achieving mainstream blockchain adoption.\nLeadership and Institutional Backing\nExecutive Team &amp; Technical Expertise\nSui Network's team brings together an exceptional team of former Meta (Facebook) engineers who previously worked on the Diem blockchain and Move programming language. This technical pedigree is evident in the protocol's architecture and execution. The founding team includes Evan Cheng (CEO), a 27-year tech industry veteran and co-recipient of the 2012 ACM System Award who spent 10 years at Apple leading developer tooling and programming language initiatives before his 6.5 years at Meta where he led the Libra R&amp;D team; Sam Blackshear (CTO), the principal creator of the Move programming language; Adeniyi Abiodun (CPO), who built one of the largest Bitcoin mining operations in the world after working in finance and later launched blockchain products at Oracle and VMware before joining Meta's Novi division (Meta's digital wallet initiative for cryptocurrency payments); and George Danezis (Chief Scientist), a renowned expert in security and privacy with significant experience at Microsoft and University College London.\nInstitutional Capital &amp; Investment Rounds\nThe project has attracted substantial institutional investment across multiple rounds, raising a total of $385.37M. The Series A round in December 2021 raised $36M at a $1.8B valuation, with participation from notable investors including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Samsung Next, and Coinbase Ventures. This was followed by a significant Series B round in September 2022, raising $300M at a $2.5B valuation, with investments from Circle Ventures, Jump Capital, and Binance Labs, among others.\nThe public token sales phase in April-May 2023 raised an additional $49.37M through various IEO platforms including OKX Jumpstart and KuCoin Spotlight. The vesting schedules were structured to ensure long-term alignment, with Series A vesting completed in January 2024 and Series B in October 2024. The public rounds followed a more accelerated schedule with monthly unlocks, demonstrating a balanced approach to token distribution.\n\nSource: Sui (SUI) IEO Funding Rounds, Token Sale Review &amp; Tokenomics Analysis | CryptoRank.ioThis combination of deep technical expertise and strong institutional backing has provided Sui with both the intellectual and financial resources necessary for long-term ecosystem development.\nBuilding with Institutions: Momentum and Collaboration\nInstitutional adoption represents a critical validation signal for blockchain technology, indicating the transition from experimental infrastructure to production-ready systems capable of supporting significant financial and technological operations. Sui's rapid institutional engagement across multiple sectors provides perhaps the strongest evidence of its long-term potential beyond purely technical metrics or retail adoption.\nThe financial sector's embrace of Sui has been particularly noteworthy for both its breadth and the caliber of institutions involved. VanEck's introduction of regulated SUI-backed financial products in November 2024 marked a significant milestone, expanding access to traditional investment portfolios and retirement accounts. Franklin Templeton's strategic ecosystem partnership, announced just nine days later, was even more surprising—this 77-year-old asset manager with over $1.5 trillion under management isn't known for technological experimentation, making their commitment particularly validating. A compelling indicator of institutional confidence emerged with Grayscale Investments' SUI Trust launch in September 2024. As the largest digital asset manager globally, Grayscale's product selection process is notoriously selective, typically focusing on only the most established cryptocurrencies. Their relatively early commitment to Sui suggests extraordinary confidence in the protocol's long-term position.\nExpanding its reach into traditional financial markets, Sui has recently announced a significant collaboration with the ATHEX Group, the entity supporting the organization and development of the Greek Capital Market. This partnership brings Greece's national stock exchange onchain with Sui, with Mysten Labs and ATHEX working together to build a ZK-powered fundraising platform. This initiative highlights how Sui's technology is being leveraged to enhance privacy and speed within traditional capital markets, showcasing real-world finance meeting next-gen blockchain.\nThese financial products are complemented by infrastructure partnerships that enhance Sui's institutional capabilities. Circle's integration brings native USDC to the ecosystem, providing the stable value foundation required for serious institutional participation. Copper's custody solutions enable secure asset management for enterprise users, while Zero Hash and Fordefi provide institutional-grade transaction infrastructure. This comprehensive suite of financial services creates an environment where traditional institutions can engage with Sui without compromising their operational requirements or regulatory obligations—a crucial factor that has limited institutional adoption of many other blockchain platforms.\nTechnology partnerships further extend Sui's institutional reach beyond finance. The collaboration with Google Cloud goes beyond basic infrastructure support to include deeper AI integration capabilities and enterprise-grade security implementations. This relationship provides not just technical enhancements but also significant credibility with traditional enterprises exploring blockchain adoption. Similarly, the partnership with BytePlus (ByteDance's enterprise technology subsidiary) expands Sui's reach into Asian markets while potentially enabling novel applications at the intersection of social media, content delivery, and blockchain verification—a combination that could prove particularly powerful as digital content authenticity becomes increasingly valuable.\nAnother notable evolution is how these institutional relationships are increasingly bidirectional rather than simply validational. Franklin Templeton isn't merely investing in Sui but actively participating in ecosystem development through its digital asset arm. Google Cloud's partnership involves mutual technology development rather than simple service provision. This evolution from passive investment to active collaboration suggests that institutions are beginning to view Sui not just as a speculative blockchain play but as strategic infrastructure worth integrating into their long-term technology strategies.\nThe convergence of these institutional relationships creates substantial network effects that benefit the entire Sui ecosystem. Financial products generate liquidity and price discovery mechanisms that attract additional capital. Infrastructure partnerships enhance security and reliability, making the network more attractive for developers building mission-critical applications. Technology collaborations expand Sui's capabilities into new domains, potentially opening entirely new market segments. Collectively, these institutional engagements create a foundation for sustainable growth that extends well beyond retail speculation or short-term token appreciation—they position Sui as serious infrastructure for the future financial and technological landscape, establishing a relationship that is mutualistic, not parasitic, where all participants contribute to and benefit from the network's growth..\nThe Competitive Landscape\nIn the Layer 1 blockchain landscape, Sui primarily competes with two major protocols: Aptos, sharing the Move programming language heritage, and Solana, which similarly emphasizes high performance and low costs. Understanding this competitive dynamics provides crucial context for evaluating Sui's market position and long-term potential.\nThe technical architectures of these protocols reveal philosophically different approaches to blockchain scalability and performance. Sui's Mysticeti consensus achieves sub-400ms finality through its innovative DAG-based structure and parallel transaction processing. This significantly outperforms both Aptos, which targets 800ms finality with its Raptr upgrade, and Solana's 2-3 second finality using Proof-of-History. While these performance differences might seem marginal in abstract terms, they represent fundamental capabilities gaps for applications where transaction confirmation directly impacts user experience, such as gaming or high-frequency trading.\n\nAnalysis of finality times, consensus mechanisms, and scaling approachesBeyond comparative benchmarks, the contrasting philosophies toward scaling highlight the deeper strategic differences at play. Sui has embraced horizontal scaling, designing its architecture to maintain performance as more validators join the network and activity increases. This contrasts sharply with Solana's vertical scaling philosophy, which prioritizes maximizing the performance of individual validators through increasingly powerful hardware requirements. The practical implications of this difference become apparent during periods of network stress: while Solana has experienced several complete network outages during periods of high demand, Sui's architecture is specifically designed to avoid \"penalizing success\" through surge pricing or performance degradation when popular applications drive increased usage.\nThis architectural distinction extends to gas fees and pricing models. Sui employs a predictable gas fee structure where validators set reference prices per epoch, enabling reliable cost estimation for users and developers. This contrasts with the highly variable gas fees experienced on blockchains like Ethereum and increasingly on Solana during periods of congestion. The stability of Sui's fee structure makes it particularly suitable for applications with frequent microtransactions, such as gaming or social applications, where unpredictable fee spikes can severely disrupt user experience.\nFrom an ecosystem development perspective, the relationship between Sui, Aptos, and Solana demonstrates fascinating patterns of competition and collaboration. Sui and Aptos share the Move programming language foundation, creating network effects that benefit both chains as developers can leverage their Move expertise across multiple platforms. This has accelerated the broader Move ecosystem development while allowing each chain to differentiate through their unique technical capabilities.\nThe relationship with Solana's ecosystem shows an emerging pattern of expansion rather than migration. The integration of the Wormhole bridge between Sui and Solana has facilitated cross-chain liquidity flows, while established Solana protocols like Solend have expanded to Sui through implementations like Suilend. This multi-chain deployment strategy by developers suggests the emergence of a blockchain landscape characterized by specialized capabilities rather than winner-take-all dynamics.\nEcosystem metrics provide quantitative context for this competitive positioning. As of February 2025, Solana leads with approximately $12.1B in TVL, demonstrating its position as a mature DeFi ecosystem. Sui follows with $2.53B TVL, showing impressive growth from $257M in January 2024. Aptos currently maintains $964M in TVL. What's particularly notable about Sui's growth trajectory is its velocity—achieving over 10x TVL growth in just one year suggests momentum that could eventually challenge Solana's position if sustained.\n\nDeFi Llama data (Jan 19, 2025) contrasts Solana's $12.19B TVL with Sui's rapidly expanding $1.96B.Fee generation offers perhaps the most valuable insight into actual economic activity. While Solana currently leads with multiple protocols generating substantial fees, Sui's leading applications are showing remarkable growth trajectories. Cetus, Sui's leading DEX, ranks #40 globally with approximately $9M in monthly fees—an impressive achievement for a protocol less than two years old.\nLooking beyond current metrics to future trends, Sui's comprehensive approach to blockchain infrastructure—balancing technical excellence with developer experience and user accessibility—positions it uniquely in the competitive landscape. Rather than competing solely on performance or ecosystem size, Sui offers a distinct value proposition through the integration of multiple capabilities that collectively address the full spectrum of blockchain adoption barriers. This multi-dimensional approach may ultimately prove more sustainable than the more focused strategies employed by some competitors.\nTokenomics and Community Engagement\nA blockchain's economic model and community dynamics play crucial roles in its long-term sustainability and growth potential. Sui's approach to both these dimensions reflects a deliberate strategy focused on quality over quantity and long-term alignment over short-term speculation, a strategy we've explored extensively in our 3-part analysis.\nSui's tokenomics are built around a fixed maximum supply of 10 billion SUI tokens. A detailed allocation and controlled release schedule are central to balancing ecosystem growth with price stability and preventing short-term speculation. Unlike many Layer 1 blockchains that distribute significant portions of their token supply through airdrops, Sui has deliberately avoided this approach in favor of more selective mechanisms, a decision rooted in the view that airdrops can attract a 'bad crowd,' as noted by one Sui team member. However, as we have argued in our extensive research “Airdropping: Some Truths”, the outcome is often dependent on the way an airdrop is properly designed. As Evan Cheng explains, \"We made a conscious decision not to do traditional airdrops. We wanted to attract a community of genuinely interested participants who are here for the technology and long-term potential, not just short-term token rewards.\" This strategy aims to cultivate a community of genuinely interested participants rather than short-term profit seekers—a distinction that has proven increasingly valuable as the ecosystem matures.\nThe token allocation is structured to ensure long-term alignment and broad distribution over time. Key allocations include a significant portion for Community Reserves, Stake Subsidies, and funds allocated after 2030, alongside distributions to Early Contributors, Series A, and Series B investors. The vesting schedule, which governs the timing of token unlocks for various participants, is a crucial component of this controlled release mechanism, impacting the circulating supply over time. Detailed information on the allocation breakdown and vesting schedule is available, sourced from data providers like CryptoRank.\n\nSUI Token Allocation Breakdown. Source: CryptoRankThe token's utility encompasses multiple functions within the ecosystem. SUI serves as the native gas token for transaction fees, provides governance rights for protocol decisions, and enables staking for network security. With 32.5% of the total supply in circulation as of April 2025, the controlled release of tokens helps prevent price volatility while maintaining sufficient liquidity. Approximately 50% of all tokens are allocated to community initiatives including developer grants, educational programs, and ecosystem growth. The current staking APY of approximately 2.5% represents a sustainable emission rate that rewards long-term holders without excessive dilution. This balanced approach to staking rewards contributes to the token's monetary premium while ensuring network security through sufficient validator participation.\n\nSUI Vesting Schedule Breakdown. Source: CryptoRankCommunity engagement extends far beyond tokenomics to include robust educational initiatives, developer support programs, and regional growth strategies. The Sui Foundation's grant program, offering between $10,000 and $100,000 to promising projects, has catalyzed ecosystem development across multiple verticals. The Sui Global Accelerator Program provides more comprehensive support for high-potential teams, including funding, technical guidance, and business development assistance. These programs collectively foster organic ecosystem growth by empowering developers to build applications that leverage Sui's unique capabilities.\nThe community's composition reflects Sui's deliberate focus on quality engagement. By avoiding indiscriminate token distribution, Sui has attracted participants with genuine interest in the platform's capabilities rather than purely speculative motivations. This community quality manifests in substantive technical discussions, constructive feedback on protocol improvements, and collaborative problem-solving across development challenges. The sustained growth in developer participation—from 13 to 892 monthly active developers—demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in cultivating a vibrant builder community.\nThe community has also played a crucial role in refining Sui's user-centric features. For example, feedback from early zkLogin implementations led to improvements in the authentication flow and additional privacy protections, creating a more seamless experience for mainstream users. This responsive development approach creates a virtuous cycle where community input directly enhances the platform's capabilities, which in turn attracts more users and developers.\nRegional initiatives have further expanded Sui's global reach and cultural diversity. The protocol has established strong presences in key markets including North America, Europe, and Asia, with particular momentum in emerging blockchain hubs like Singapore and Dubai. This geographic distribution not only enhances network resilience but also enables the ecosystem to incorporate diverse perspectives and use cases that reflect different regional priorities and regulatory environments.\nEducational resources play a critical role in community building and expansion. The Sui Academy provides structured learning pathways for developers at various skill levels, while regular workshops and hackathons offer hands-on experience with the platform's capabilities. These educational initiatives reduce barriers to entry for new developers while ensuring that existing builders can fully leverage Sui's advanced features. The feedback loop between education, development, and community growth creates a virtuous cycle that continually strengthens the ecosystem.\nThe interconnection between tokenomics and community engagement represents one of Sui's most subtle but significant strengths. By aligning economic incentives with long-term ecosystem development rather than short-term speculation, Sui has created an environment where community participation naturally contributes to platform growth and value creation. This alignment positions the protocol for sustainable expansion driven by genuine utility rather than market cycles—a crucial distinction in the volatile blockchain landscape.\nFuture Growth Vectors\nLooking beyond current achievements to future possibilities, several key vectors are likely to shape Sui's continued evolution and market position. These growth paths build upon existing strengths while expanding into emerging opportunities that leverage Sui's unique capabilities.\nThe gaming vertical represents perhaps the most immediately promising expansion opportunity. With 65 studios actively building on Sui and over 70 titles scheduled for release throughout 2025, the platform is positioned to capture significant market share in the nascent blockchain gaming sector. The SuiPlay0X1 hardware initiative further strengthens this position by creating dedicated infrastructure optimized for blockchain gaming experiences. As traditional gaming studios increasingly explore blockchain integration, Sui's combination of high performance, developer-friendly tools, and user-accessible features provides compelling advantages over competing platforms.\nInstitutional adoption presents another significant growth vector. The existing relationships with financial institutions like VanEck, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale provide a foundation for deeper integration with traditional finance. These partnerships are increasingly bidirectional, with institutions not merely investing in Sui but actively participating in ecosystem development. Franklin Templeton isn't just offering SUI-backed financial products but engaging directly with protocol development through its digital asset arm. This evolution from passive investment to active collaboration suggests institutions view Sui as strategic infrastructure worth integrating into their long-term technology strategies rather than just another speculative asset.\nAs regulatory frameworks for digital assets continue to mature, Sui's institutional-grade infrastructure—including native USDC integration, advanced trading venues like DeepBook, and comprehensive custody solutions—positions it to capture increasing institutional capital flows. The potential development of regulated financial products built directly on Sui, rather than merely tracking its token price, could create powerful new connections between blockchain capabilities and traditional financial services.\nReal-world asset (RWA) tokenization emerges as a promising frontier that builds upon Sui's existing strengths. The protocol's combination of institutional-grade security, high performance, and programmable ownership makes it well-suited for representing traditional assets on-chain. Early implementations like USDY demonstrate the potential for bringing real-world yield to blockchain environments, while partnerships with companies like Copper provide the necessary custody infrastructure for institutional RWA adoption. As traditional assets increasingly migrate to blockchain representations, Sui's architecture offers advantages in security, scalability, and user accessibility that could position it as a preferred platform for this emerging sector.\nAI integration represents a more speculative but potentially transformative growth vector. Sui's founders have articulated a vision for the blockchain as a coordination layer for AI agents, enabling secure and efficient interaction between autonomous systems. As Adeniyi Abiodun explains, \"Sui can serve as a decentralized, neutral mechanism for AI agents to communicate and exchange value.\" The combination of performant infrastructure, native ownership primitives, and programmable transaction capabilities creates possibilities for AI-driven applications that can transact and coordinate on-chain. While this integration remains in early stages, the strategic partnership with Google Cloud enhances Sui's positioning to capture opportunities at the intersection of AI and blockchain—potentially one of the most significant technological convergences in the coming years.\nCross-chain interoperability continues to grow in importance as the blockchain landscape evolves toward a multi-chain reality rather than single-chain dominance. Sui's existing bridges to Ethereum and other major chains, coupled with integration of Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), position it as a connected participant in the broader blockchain ecosystem. Future enhancements to cross-chain functionality, potentially including more sophisticated asset transfers and cross-chain smart contract interactions, could further strengthen Sui's role as both a standalone platform and a complementary environment within the broader blockchain landscape.\nTechnical roadmap advancements will build upon Sui's existing architectural advantages. Continued optimization of the Mysticeti consensus mechanism could further improve finality times and throughput, while additional protocol-level primitives may enhance developer capabilities and user experiences. The ongoing evolution of the Move language ecosystem, including improved development tools and formal verification methods, will likely strengthen Sui's position as a secure and developer-friendly platform. These technical improvements, while perhaps less visible than market-facing initiatives, provide the foundation for all other growth vectors by continuously enhancing the platform's fundamental capabilities.\nAcross all these vectors, Sui's comprehensive approach to blockchain infrastructure—balancing technical excellence, developer experience, and user accessibility—creates multiple paths for continued growth and adoption. Rather than relying on a single breakout application or market segment, this diversified strategy positions Sui to capture opportunities across multiple domains simultaneously, reducing dependency on any particular trend or market cycle. This multi-dimensional growth potential represents perhaps the strongest argument for Sui's long-term position in the blockchain landscape.\nConclusion: More Than the Sum of Its Parts\nBlockchain success ultimately derives not from any single technological breakthrough but from the careful orchestration of multiple elements working in harmony. Sui exemplifies this principle through a comprehensive design philosophy that addresses the full spectrum of adoption barriers simultaneously rather than focusing narrowly on isolated metrics or capabilities.\nWhat distinguishes Sui isn't that it achieves absolute superiority in any particular dimension—though its 400ms finality, native CLOB, and zkLogin features certainly represent category-leading innovations—but rather that it maintains excellence across the entire constellation of factors that influence blockchain adoption and utility. The Move programming language provides security by design, while parallel transaction execution enables performance at scale. Programmable Transaction Blocks lower development barriers, while sponsored transactions and zkLogin remove user friction. DeepBook offers institutional-grade trading infrastructure, while the Sui Name System makes blockchain interactions intuitive for mainstream users.\nThis multifaceted approach has translated into remarkable growth across all key ecosystem metrics. From 13 million to 8.44 billion total transactions in less than two years. From $257 million to a peak of $3.5 billion in TVL in just one year. From 584,000 to 45.3 million active accounts. From 13 to 892 monthly active developers. These aren't just impressive numbers—they're validation signals demonstrating that Sui's comprehensive strategy resonates with the market's needs and expectations.\nSui's core impact on the ecosystem stems from narrowing the gap between blockchain capabilities and practical real-world utility. Through initiatives like Spritzfinance's debit card integration, Stash's Venmo-like payment experience, and SuiPlay0X1's dedicated gaming hardware, Sui is extending blockchain functionality beyond crypto-native users to mainstream applications. This practical utility, combined with growing institutional adoption through partnerships with companies like Franklin Templeton, Google Cloud, and Circle, positions Sui at the convergence point of consumer and institutional blockchain adoption—potentially the sweet spot for capturing the next wave of blockchain growth.\nAs the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, the projects most likely to achieve sustained relevance aren't those with the highest theoretical transaction throughput or the most novel consensus mechanism, but those that solve the complete puzzle of what makes distributed systems valuable to users, developers, and institutions. By maintaining balance across technical excellence, developer experience, and user accessibility, Sui exemplifies this holistic approach to blockchain infrastructure—less a single innovation than a constellation of capabilities working together to create something greater than the sum of its parts.\nIn a field often captivated by singular breakthroughs and isolated metrics, Sui reminds us that true technological revolutions rarely hinge on doing one thing extraordinarily well, but rather on doing many things extraordinarily well together. This lesson extends beyond blockchain to all emerging technologies: lasting impact comes not from isolated brilliance but from comprehensive excellence across the full spectrum of factors that transform technological potential into practical utility.\n\nWe value your insights.

This is a brief outline of the developer-facing Sui roadmap; this thread tracks the first half of 2024. If you’re interested in updates on these items, you can subscribe to this thread, and you’ll be notified when we announce releases. If you’re interested in updates more generally, you can subscribe to the Developer Announcements forum.\n\nWhere possible, we’ve tried to give potential timelines for these upcoming items. But nothing here can be taken as absolute proof of anything happening at any given time. We’re sharing this roadmap out of a desire to be helpful to our community and in the spirit of open-source.\n\nHighlights of items/dates:\n\nCategory\nItem\nRelease Date\n\nMove 2024\nLate February\n\nRPC 2.0\nLate January\n\nDeveloper Tooling\nSui CLI PTB support\nMid February\n\nWindows binaries in Chocolatey\nQ1\n\nGas Profiler\nQ1\n\nToolchain Versioning\nLate Februrary\n\nBCS/JSON (De)Serialization\nLate March\n\nRust SDK Refresh\nQ1\n\nCrypto\nVerifiable Delay Functions\nMid February\n\nEncrypted NFTs\nLate March\n\nRandomness Beacon\nLater this year\n\nDRAND Improvements\nLater this year\n\nExecution\nShared Object Deletion\nEarly February\n\nClosed Loop Token\nQ1\n\nEverything Else\nSuiNS .move service\nLater this year\n\nNative Bridge\nLater this year\n\nMove 2024\n\nMove 2024 is what we’re calling several initiatives to modernize the Move language this year. Many of these are changes to the source language – they will enhance the developer experience without requiring any changes to the binary representation published on-chain.\n\nPrimarily, the goal of these changes is to make Move easier to write, and hopefully easier to read. Secondarily, we will make a few breaking changes to the source language to better position the language for the future.\n\nThese new features and the breaking changes will be opt-in. Any existing code will continue to compile. This also means that you will be able to write your packages with the new features, even if your dependencies do not.\n\nThese features will be developed and rolled-out over the coming months (and some have already landed!). In order to give builders time to migrate to Move 2024, the first new feature we’ll be releasing is support in the Move toolchain for language flavor control in late February. This will give you the ability to decide which version of Move your code is compiled under. You can opt-in to Move 2024 features already by specifying edition = “2024.alpha” under the [package] section in your Move.toml. Later in 2024, edition = “2024” will become the default.\n\nFor more information, see the overarching Move 2024 github issue, or our recent Sui blog post.\n\nMajor features\n\nMethod syntax\n\nRefinement of the method syntax to be more intuitive and user-friendly, facilitating easier method declaration and invocation. For more information, see issue 14063.\n\nIndex syntax\n\nBuilding on Method syntax, we will add syntax for index accesses depending on the type of access.\n\nMacro functions\n\nTarget release: Late February 2024\n\nIncorporation of macro functions, allowing for more powerful and concise code patterns, reducing redundancy.\n\nEnums\n\nTarget release: Q2 2024\n\nImplementation of Enums to extend the language’s type system, introducing a new way to define and use enumerated types.\n\nMinor features\n\nTyped Macro Functions &amp; Move 2024 Beta pre-release\n\nTarget release: Late February 2024\n\nFurther refinement of macro functions and preparation for a beta release to gather community feedback and insights.\n\npublic(package)\n\nTarget release: Late February 2024\n\nExpansion of the visibility modifier system, introducing public(package) for more nuanced access control within package boundaries.\n\nPositional fields\n\nTarget release: Late February 2024\n\nEnhancement of struct definitions with positional fields, improving the clarity and readability of data structures.\n\nPostfix has ability declarations\n\nTarget release: Late February 2024\n\nA new postfix syntax for ability declarations, making the expression of constraints more natural and intuitive in the language.\n\nType inference holes on type annotations\n\nTarget release: Late February 2024\n\nAdvanced type inference capabilities, aimed at simplifying the process of annotating types, particularly in complex scenarios.\n\nBreak with value\n\nTarget release: Late February 2024\n\nEnabling break statements in loops to return values, facilitating more expressive and powerful control flow constructs.\n\nRPC 2.0\n\nTarget release: Late January 2024\n\nRPC 2.0 is a major effort to re-imagine Sui’s RPCs. You can read more about it on Github. Our interactive demo has been available since late 2023; builders can use this to help with their transition to the new GraphQL RPC API. RPC 2.0 will be fully available in late January 2024. Going forward, RPCs will adopt a quarterly release schedule with a versioning scheme of [year].[month].[patch], breaking changes will be reserved for [year].[month] versions, and each RPC major version will be supported for 6 months for bugfixes. The previous RPC version will not be deprecated until after Q2 2024.\n\nDeveloper Tooling\n\nSui CLI PTB Support\n\nTarget release: Mid February 2024\n\nCurrently, the only way to test PTBs is to use a Sui SDK. This isn’t ideal for experimentation and ad-hoc testing. So, we are adding support for building and executing PTB’s within the Sui CLI. PTBs can be fully constructed either on the command line, or read from a file using a similar format.\n\nWindows Sui binaries in Chocolatey\n\nTarget release: Q1 2024\n\nWhile OS X and GNU/Linux users can take advantage of Homebrew or Cargo to install and upgrade Sui binaries, Windows users only have the option of manually installing binaries from our Github releases. We will be adding these binaries to Chocolatey so that Windows users can also take advantage of a package-manager workflow to keep their binaries updated. We hope this makes developer onboarding a more seamless experience for Windows developers.\n\nGas profiler\n\nTarget release: Q1 2024\n\nGas fees are a critical component of any dApp. To help builders assess how their dApps consume gas, we’ve been working on a tool to profile and visualize gas usage in applications, based on the Chrome profiler. This has made it much easier for us to understand gas usage internally and we hope it will be as useful for external developers.\n\nToolchain Versioning\n\nTarget release: Late February 2024\n\nToolchain versioning ensures that when a package is published and its dependencies are verified, the process is conducted using the original toolchain that built the published dependency, rather than the current toolchain in use. This approach is critical because verification involves a byte-for-byte comparison of the bytecode. Utilizing the original toolchain prevents the occurrence of verification failures that could arise from benign changes introduced by newer toolchains.\n\nBCS/JSON (De)Serialization C Library\n\nTarget release: Late March 2024\n\nBinary Canonical Serialization, or BCS, is the data format used to represent data on Sui, but many languages lack support for BCS. We will be providing a canonical implementation of BCS serialization and deserialization from and to JSON in a Rust library with an easy to use C API. Builders working in language ecosystems without a BCS implementation can call this library using their languages FFI support. For more information, see issue 13483.\n\nRust SDK Refresh\n\nTarget release: Q1 2024\n\nWe will be releasing a major refactor of our Rust SDK to add support for GraphQL querying as well as streamlining transaction building.\n\nCrypto\n\nVerifiable Delay Functions\n\nTarget release: Mid February 2024\n\nA verifiable delay function (VDF) is a deterministic function which takes a certain time to evaluate, even if multiple computers are allowed to work in parallel to evaluate it. But once evaluated, the output may be quickly verified by anyone.\n\nVDF’s can be used to construct verifiable, unbiasable on-chain randomness and as also used as a proof-of-work for some blockchain designs. See section 2 in Verifiable Delay Functions by Boneh et. al https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/601.pdf for a survey of applications.\n\nIn Sui the usage will be for a continuous supply of on-chain randomness where we only need to assume that 1-out-of-n parties is honest. This can be implemented as a service provided by Mysten and requires only the addition of a few functions to the Sui framework and a smart contract.\n\nEncrypted NFTs\n\nTarget release: Late March 2024\n\nMost NFT marketplaces reveal user identities, bids, transactions, and other information including the content of NFTs to the public. This restricts the scope of successful NFT categories to those which are exclusively privacy-insensitive, and also introduces the possibility of shill bidding, wash trading, and even unauthorized copying of digital assets. We will be introducing a protocol for a private NFT exchange between a seller and a buyer that uses zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nRandomness Beacon\n\nTarget release: Later in 2024\n\nWe will be adding an on-chain randomness beacon to Devnet targeting late February, and mainnet later in 2024 after testing, The goal of the randomness beacon is to provide randomness for smart contracts. That randomness must be unpredictable and unbiasable, even against a subset of malicious validators.\n\nDRAND Improvements\n\nTarget release: Devnet/Testnet Q1 2024\n\nWe are adding support for BLS12-381 group operations to be added in the future.\n\nExecution\n\nShared Object Deletion\n\nTarget release: Mainnet - Early February 2024\n\nWe are adding the capability for shared objects to be deleted (causing storage rebates to be reclaimed by the entity that submits the transaction deleting the shared object). This was released on Testnet in early January of 2024, and after testing, we hope to release this on Mainnet in early February. For more information, see issue 12653.\n\nClosed Loop Token\n\nTarget release: Q2 2024\n\nWe recently published our standard for Closed-Loop Tokens, which are similar to Coins with the caveat that the creator of a Closed-Loop Token can limit applications where the token is used and/or define custom policies for transfers, spending, and conversion. This can be used to implement loyalty points, regulatory-compliant tokens, or in-game currencies, among other things. We will be releasing more support across RPCs, fullnodes, indexers, and our SDKs for this standard.\n\nOther Upcoming Features and Improvements\n\nSuiNS: .move Service\n\nTarget release: Later this year\n\nThe .move service is an extension of SuiNS to provide an on-chain service that maps human-readable names to object ids. The .move service will allow builders and community members to identify and understand objects on Sui, and to quickly identify and discover packages for their development needs, without having to memorize complex addresses or verifying authors. Wallets can interact with the .move service to enable users to understand if the packages they are interacting with are legitimate.\n\nNative Bridge\n\nTarget release: Later this year\n\nTo empower more types of cross chain communication and diversify bridging experiences on Sui, we’ll be introducing Sui Bridge, a trustless native bridge leveraging Sui’s security model. This bridge will rely on the same security assumptions as Sui’s core network, and hence trusting Sui Bridge will require the same security assumptions as trusting Sui itself. Sui Bridge will start as a fungible token bridge between Sui and Ethereum, while being extensible so as to support new assets, message types, and chains in the future. For more information, see issue 14983.\n\n6\n\n​\n\n​\n\nI Need Insights on Sui Protocol's Scalability Solutions\n\n7.1k\n\nviews\n\n9\n\nlikes\n\n15\n\nlinks\n\nread\n\n7\nmin\n\nPinned on Jan 29, 2024\n\nClosed on Jan 29, 2024\n\n2 months later\n\ntedksSui Maintainer\n3\nApr 2024\n\nIt’s been an exciting few months in the Sui Ecosystem. Much of our previously discussed enhancements are now live, including the Move 2024 compiler &amp; framework support, many improvements to the Sui CLI including PTB support, faucet support, transaction replay and gas profiling, transfer to object, and shared object deletion. Some work has been rescheduled for later this year, including our Rust SDK refresh and BCS/JSON (de)serialization library.

Let’s get into it.\n\nCategory\nItem\nRelease Date\n\nRPC\nREST API\nEarly 2025\n\nGraphQL Rust SDK\n2024-Q4\n\nLocal Execution Deprecation\n2024-08-13\n\nDeveloper Tooling\nSui VSCode Extension\n2024-Q4\n\nMove Autoformatter\n2024-Q4\n\nMove Registry\n2024-Q4\n\nReducing environmental friction\n2025\n\nDebugging improvements\n2024-Q4 and ongoing\n\nLockstep network\n2025\n\nSandbox testing\n2025\n\nExecution\nCongestion Control\n2024-Q4\n\nDeepbook v3\nQ4\n\nDisplay v2\n2025\n\nCoinMetadata v2\n2025\n\nRPC\n\nREST API\n\nWe are developing a REST API that will eventually replace the existing JSON-RPC API for accessing data from Sui fullnodes. This will offer access to the core functionality that JSON-RPC currently provides, and more.\n\nLook for this coming early next year, and for more releases in this space over the next year.\n\nGraphQL Rust SDK\n\nWe are rebuilding our Rust SDK. This will support GraphQL, as well as making several other improvements.\n\nComing Q4 2024.\n\nLocal Execution Deprecation\n\nThe local execution feature has been deprecated. For more info, see the deprecation announcement.\n\nDev Tooling\n\nSui VSCode Extension\n\nWe have made (and continue to make) improvements to our VSCode extension for Sui development. Try it out now for smart autocompletion, and stay tuned for more great features.\n\nWe will be releasing multiple updates to the Sui VSCode extension throughout the end of the year - stay tuned.\n\nMove Autoformatter\n\nWe are developing a Prettier-based autoformatter for Move code in response to many requests for this functionality.\n\nComing later this year.\n\nMove Registry\n\nTired of staring at 64-character hex addresses in PTBs, Move.toml, and some other places? Soon, you can register a human-readable name for your Move package on the Move registry and say goodbye to random hex strings forever.\n\nMove Registry will be available later this year.\n\nPublishing to multiple environments\n\nWe are making a number of changes to the Move compiler and build system that will streamline the developer experience around publishing your Move package across mainnet and testnet.\n\nComing early 2025.\n\nVarious debugging improvements\n\nWe are working on a variety of approaches to make debugging Move code possible, easy, and painless. There will be multiple releases over the coming months in this space, starting with tooling to replay transactions that happened on-chain with gas profiling and other trace information.\n\nLockstep Network\n\nWe are building a lockstep network that will allow developers to use a local network that only runs when interacted with, enabling a much lighter-weight local network experience. This will be initializable from an existing chain state to ease debugging.\n\nComing in 2025.\n\nSandbox testing\n\nWe are working on tooling to enable tests that require multiple on-chain actions such as publishing packages, running transactions, and querying chain state.\n\nComing in 2025.\n\nFramework/Execution\n\nCongestion Control\n\nA new congestion control mechanism has been introduced in Sui mainnet version 1.31. This enhanced internal mechanism more accurately tracks transaction execution dependencies and can proactively defer lower-priced transactions involving hot shared objects to later checkpoints. As a result, SUI can now better manage checkpoint execution latency, provide better local fee markets, and achieve higher performance in workloads involving hot shared objects. This is recently live in mainnet.\n\nDeepbook v3\n\nThe latest version of the Deepbook framework is currently live on devnet and testnet.\n\nDeepbook v3 is currently planned on being released on Mainnet in October.\n\nDisplay v2\n\nWe are rethinking and reworking the Display framework to account for what we’ve learned so far.\n\nComing in 2025.\n\nCoinMetaData\n\nWe’re rethinking and improving the CoinMetadata standard, in order to better separate CoinMetadata from TreasuryCaps, allow CoinMetadata for Supply-Balance currencies, allow upgrading Supply to TreasuryCaps in some cases, and to improve indexing of CoinMetadata with a registry. For more information, see the SIP.\n\nComing in 2025.\n\n1\n\n​\n\n​\n\nReply\n\nRelated topics\n\nTopic list, column headers with buttons are sortable.\n\nTopic\n\nReplies\n\nViews\n\nActivity\n\nAnnouncing Significant Updates to Sui’s Developer Tooling\n\nDeveloper Announcements\n\n2\n\n309\n\nDec 2024\n\nMove 2024 IDE support\n\nAnnouncements\n\nmove\n\n21\n\n1.5k\n\nMay 6\n\n0.23.0 Release Notes\n\nSui Network\n\n1\n\n2.0k\n\nJan 2023\n\nSui Move Workshops\n\nMove\n\nsui\n\n3\n\n2.0k\n\nFeb 2023\n\nSui DevX Survey - Q1 2024\n\nDeveloper Announcements\n\n0\n\n350\n\nJan 2024\n\nInvalid date\n\nInvalid date"

On Sui, the native coin is SUI, which acts as the currency of the network. SUI also pays for the computational cost of transactions (gas fees) and storage on the network.\n\nProof of stake​\n\nSui uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This means that validators (entities that validate transactions) lock up a certain amount of SUI as collateral (stake). They then earn rewards for processing operations. Users of the network hold their own SUI, which they can delegate to the validators of their choice as part of the validators' stakes. In so doing, the validators reward users based on the amount of SUI they delegate. Users are free to withdraw their SUI or to change their selected validator when the epoch changes.\n\nStakeholders​\n\nStakeholders in a blockchain's tokenomics have a vested interest in the viability of the blockchain economy. The Sui economy has three main groups of stakeholders:\n\nUsers submit transactions to the Sui platform to create, mutate, and transfer digital assets or interact with more sophisticated applications enabled by smart contracts, interoperability, and composability.\n\nSUI token holders have the option of staking their tokens to validators and participating in the proof-of-stake mechanism. SUI owners also hold the rights to participate in Sui governance.\n\nValidators manage transaction processing and execution on the Sui platform.\n\nSUI coin​\n\nAs mentioned, the native coin of Sui is SUI. The coin uses the capitalized version of SUI to distinguish the coin from the Sui network. A sound policy to govern the native coin on a blockchain ensures stability and encourages growth. The Sui tokenomics structure is designed to support the long-term financial needs of Web3, not get-rich-quick schemes that have plagued the industry in the past.\n\nThe SUI coin serves four purposes on the Sui network:\n\nYou can stake SUI to participate in the proof-of-stake mechanism.\n\nSUI is the asset denomination needed to pay the gas fees required to execute and store transactions or other operations on the Sui network.\n\nYou can use SUI as a versatile and liquid asset for various applications, including the standard features of money - a unit of account, a medium of exchange, or a store of value - and more complex functionality smart contracts enable, interoperability, and composability across the Sui ecosystem.\n\nSUI coins play an important role in governance by acting as a right to participate in on-chain voting on issues such as protocol upgrades.\n\nSupply​\n\nThe total supply of SUI tokens on Mainnet is capped at 10,000,000,000 SUI (ten billion). This is the total number of SUI that can ever be minted, but the total supply is not available for transactions. Supply availability follows the designed unlocking schedules in place to enhance the tokenomics stability of the network and provide a long-term level of security.\n\nThere is a finite supply of SUI. The balance must support all economic activities to scale as more and more people migrate to the Sui platform. In addition, the presence of a storage fund creates important monetary dynamics, in that higher on-chain data requirements translate into a larger storage fund, reducing the amount of SUI in circulation.\n\nDistribution​\n\nAt the beginning of each epoch, three important events happen:\n\nSUI holders stake (some) of their tokens to validators and a new committee is formed.\n\nThe reference gas prices are set as described in Sui Gas Pricing.\n\nThe storage fund size is adjusted using the net inflow of the previous epoch.\n\nFollowing these actions, the protocol computes the total amount of stake as the sum of staked SUI plus the storage fund.\n\nDuring each epoch, users submit transactions to the Sui platform and validators process them. For each transaction, users pay the associated computation and storage gas fees. In cases where users delete previous transaction data, users obtain a partial rebate of their storage fees. Validators observe the behavior of other validators and evaluate each other's performance.\n\nAt the end of each epoch, the protocol distributes stake rewards to participants of the PoS mechanism. This occurs through two main steps:\n\nThe total amount of stake rewards is calculated as the sum of computation fees accrued throughout the epoch plus the epoch's stake reward subsidies. The latter component is temporary in that it will only exist in the network's first years and disappear in the long run as the amount of SUI in circulation reaches its total supply.\n\nThe total amount of stake rewards is distributed across various entities. The storage fund is taken into account in the calculation of the epoch total stake, which is not owned by any entities in the way that staked SUI is. Instead, the Sui economic model distributes the stake rewards accruing to the storage fund to validators for compensation of their storage costs.\n\nThe distribution mechanisms built into Sui tokenomics encourages a healthy competition for fair prices where validators set low gas fees while operating with viable business models. Refer to the https://docs.sui.io/paper/tokenomics.pdf whitepaper for in-depth review of the mathematical proofs that support this structure.\n\nUnlocking schedules​\n\nSui tokenomics design includes a vesting schedule (or unlock schedule) that dictates when certain blocks of SUI become accessible to the market. Like most blockchains concerned with stability and long-term commitment, Sui tokenomics design includes a multi-tiered SUI unlock schedule.\n\nWhen Sui first launched its Mainnet network (initial SUI mint), there was a one-year cliff period. During this time, all initial investors were blocked from transferring their initial stake of SUI to the marketplace. A common practice for new cryptocurrency, the cliff period protected early network stability against large-scale sell-offs from early investors. The cliff period ended in May 2024.\n\nAirdrops​\n\nOften, when a new coin or token launches, its minters set aside a percentage of the sum to distribute to early adopters to drive interest in the associated blockchain project. This process is termed an “airdrop”.\n\nThere were no SUI airdrops to support the launch of Sui's Mainnet network. This was a publicly-stated, intentional decision for the following reasons:\n\nAirdrops expose a potential for bad actors to take advantage of the excitement around a new launch. By publicly stating there would be no airdrops, Sui attempted to mitigate the risk its users faced.\n\nCryptocurrency is regulated differently across the globe. Airdrops can be viewed as taxable events in some jurisdictions, creating legal or financial complications.\n\nSui is committed to the long-term success of the network and its stakeholders. Airdrops might generate excitement early in a project's lifecycle, but the long-term benefits are minimal.\n\nStorage fund​\n\nAs previously mentioned, SUI pays for the gas fees and data storage on the network. A potential problem arises, however, when new validators come on chain. Even though the validator is new, it still must pay the storage cost for activity that happened before it was part of the network.\n\nSui addresses this problem with the storage fund. The storage fund is essentially a cache of SUI that never fully depletes. Each on-chain transaction that adds data to the chain includes a fee for storage, which the protocol adds to the storage fund. The storage fund itself essentially has a stake in the network, so it collects rewards based on that stake, just like every other on-chain stakeholder. The protocol then regularly distributes those storage fund rewards to Sui validators to pay for storage. In this way, new validators to the network get paid for storing data from past transactions.\n\nStorage fund rewards​\n\nThe Sui delegated proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism calculates total stake as the sum of user stake plus the SUI tokens deposited in the storage fund. Hence, the storage fund receives a proportional share of the overall stake rewards depending on its size relative to total stake. The largest share of these stake rewards are paid out to current validators to compensate for storage costs. The rewards that remain are reinvested into the fund. In other words, stake rewards accruing to the storage fees submitted by past transactions are paid out to current validators to compensate them for data storage costs. When on-chain storage requirements are high, validators receive substantial additional rewards to compensate for their storage costs. Vice versa when storage requirements are low.\n\nThe storage fund includes three key features:\n\nThe storage fund is funded by past transactions and functions as a tool for shifting gas fees across different epochs. This ensures that future validators are compensated for their storage costs by the past users who created those storage requirements in the first place.\n\nThe storage fund pays out only the returns on its capital and does not distribute its principal. In practice, this essentially means validators borrow the storage fund's SUI as additional stake and keep the majority of stake rewards. Validators do not, however, receive funds directly from the storage fund. This guarantees the fund never loses its capitalization and can survive indefinitely. This feature is further buttressed by the stake rewards reinvested into the fund.\n\nThe storage fund includes a deletion option. If you delete data, you get a partial refund of the storage fees paid originally.\n\nDeflation​\n\nThe storage fund also contributes to the deflationary aspect of the network. Unlike traditional economics, deflation is a feature of Sui rather than a bug. The total supply of SUI is capped, so increased activity on the network has a deflationary effect as the storage fund grows in relation to the amount of data stored, which effectively takes more SUI out of circulation.  The store of value for SUI increases in relation to the decrease in circulating supply, promoting long-term investment in SUI for a strong network into the future.\n\nValidator rewards​\n\nWith traditional PoS blockchains, validator rewards are somewhat randomized based on the amount of stake a validator holds. As the validators reinvest their rewards, their stake compounds, as does the probability that they receive more rewards based on that growing stake.\n\nSui takes a novel approach to rewarding its validators to avoid this effect. All honest validators on Sui receive their staking rewards with full certainty. The rewards are based only on the amount of stake the validators hold, removing randomness from the equation.\n\nValidators and staking pools​\n\nEach Sui validator maintains its own staking pool to track the amount of stake and to compound staking rewards. Validator pools operate together with a time series of exchange rates that are computed at each epoch boundary. These exchange rates determine the amount of SUI tokens that each past SUI staker can withdraw in the future. Importantly, the exchange rates increase as more rewards are deposited into a staking pool and the longer an amount of SUI is deposited in a staking pool, the more rewards it will accrue.\n\nWhen SUI is deposited to the staking pool in epoch E, those SUI are converted into liquidity tokens at the epoch E exchange rate. As the staking pool earns rewards, the exchange rate appreciates. At epoch E', those liquidity tokens are worth more and translate into more SUI.\nThe only difference between Sui staking pools and typical liquidity pools is that in Sui the liquidity tokens do not exist. Rather, the global exchange rate table is used to track the accounting. Because all SUI tokens in the staking pool are treated the same, regardless of whether they were originally deposited as new stake or as stake rewards, all SUI tokens immediately count as stake and thus compound rewards immediately.\n\nThe staking pool is implemented in a system-level smart contract (staking_pool.move) and is part of the Sui framework.\n\nValidator pool exchange rate​\n\nThe exchange rate for each validator pool is calculated at each epoch boundary as follows:\n\nExchange rate at E+1 = ( 1 + ( third-party staker rewards at E / third-party stake at E )) ( exchange rate at E )\n\nThe distinction between third-party owned vs validator-owned rewards and stake is relevant in that validators earn commissions on the staking pool's tokens but third-party stakers do not. This accounting enables Sui to keep track of the rewards accrued by both validators and third-party token holders using a single global exchange rate table.\n\nValidator staking pool requirements​\n\nThere are minimum staking requirements a validator must satisfy to become active and to stay in the active validator set.\n\nStake Requirements​\n\nThe Sui network is rolling out SIP-39, which will significantly lower the barrier to entry for validators. Instead of requiring a minimum amount of SUI tokens, validators will need a minimum amount of voting power.\n\nWhen fully rolled out, SIP-39 will mean the following validator requirements:\n\nA validator candidate must accrue at least 3 voting power before they can request to join the validator set.\n\nIf an active validator's stake falls below 2 voting power, they have seven epochs of grace period to gain back the stake before being removed from the validator set.\n\nIf an active validator's stake falls below 1 voting power, they are removed from the validator set at the end of the current epoch boundary. Sui uses 24-hour epochs.\n\nFor more information on voting power, see Understanding the voting power formula.\n\ntip\nWant to be a Sui validator?\nIf you have the required stake and plan to operate a validator on Sui, your participation is welcome and Sui is committed to supporting your onboarding. Kindly complete this form to be added to our Validator Discord and keep up with upcoming validator releases and technical support.\n\nUnderstanding the voting power formula​\n\nSIP-39 uses the following formula to determine if a validator can join the set:\n\nS / (S + T) &gt; V / 10000\n\nWhere:\n\nS = The validator candidate's stake amount\n\nT = Total amount already staked in the network\n\nV = Minimum voting power threshold (3 in the final phase)\n\n10000 = Total voting power units in the Sui system\n\nThis formula checks if the validator would have at least V voting power after joining. Let's break it down:\n\nS / (S + T) calculates what proportion of the total stake the validator would control\n\nWhen multiplied by 10000, this gives their voting power in Sui's standardized units\n\nThe validator can join if this value is greater than or equal to the threshold V\n\nFor example, with a network stake of 7.69B SUI and V=3:\n\nA validator with 2.31M SUI would have: 2,310,000 / (2,310,000 + 7,694,950,773) ≈ 0.0003 proportion\n\nConverting to voting power: 0.0003 × 10000 ≈ 3 units\n\nSince 3 ≥ 3, they meet the threshold to join\n\nAs the total network stake changes, the minimum required amount will adjust automatically.\n\nRelated links​\n\nThe Sui Smart Contracts Platform: Economics and Incentives: Whitepaper that details Sui tokenomics.\n\nGas fees: Gas fees are charged on all network operations and used to reward participants of the proof-of-stake mechanism and prevent spam and denial-of-service attacks.\n\nEdit this page\n\nPrevious\nProtocol Upgrades\nNext\nStaking and Unstaking\n\nProof of stake\nStakeholders\nSUI coinSupply\nDistribution\nUnlocking schedules\nAirdrops\n\nStorage fundStorage fund rewards\nDeflation\n\nValidator rewards\nValidators and staking poolsValidator pool exchange rate\nValidator staking pool requirements\n\nRelated links\n\n© 2025 Sui Foundation | Documentation distributed under CC BY 4.0"

The Move language allows parallel execution without adding additional complexity for node operators.\n\nTo keep pace with the cutting-edge infrastructure design, Sui implements a robust economic model that is designed to incentivize entities participating in the ecosystem. There are three main players in the Sui ecosystem:\n\nSui Users: Users are actors who submit transactions, create, mutate, and transpose objects and interact with smart contracts.\n\nSui Token holders: These are the owners of the native token called SUI and have the option to stake their tokens to secure the network and earn additional SUI tokens as a reward. They can also participate in Sui’s governance operations. &nbsp;\n\nValidators: Validators compile and validate transactions submitted by users and secure the network.&nbsp;\n\n‍\n\nFigment’s Involvement\n\nFigment is currently a part of the permissioned testnet validator set and will continue to be a part of the Sui ecosystem upon the arrival of mainnet. The testnet aims to stabilize the network by running formulated tests to ensure the network is performing optimally. We are very excited to be a part of the Sui ecosystem and will be supporting the Mysten Labs team as the journey progresses. Mysten Labs is building the foundations for the decentralized future. Mysten Labs is a team of Web3 builders focused on laying the foundation for a decentralized future.\n\nStay tuned for our Staking Guide if you want to learn how to stake SUI. Meanwhile, you can reach out to sales@figment.io to learn more.\n\n‍\n\nThe Economy\n\nThe Sui ecosystem consists of 5 vital components, each playing a interrelated role:\n\nThe SUI Token as the native token.\n\nGas Fees: All network operations are levied with transaction fees aka gas fees, and used to reward actors taking part in the PoS mechanism.\n\nSui Storage Fund: Used to compensate validators for storing on-chain object related data.\n\nDelegated PoS: At the end of each epoch (an epoch can be defined as a fixed timeframe to provide validators a common frame of reference for scheduled events on a blockchain), the protocol distributes staking rewards to participants of the proof-of-stake mechanism. This is to incentivize and reward validators for honest behavior and securing the chain.\n\nOn-chain governance: Used to govern chain parameters and protocol upgrades.&nbsp;\n\n‍\n\nThe SUI token\n\nSui utilizes the native token called SUI. This means that SUI will be used as the primary medium of exchange and a store of value. The max supply for SUI is capped at 10,000,000,000 (10bn) and a large portion of the total supply will be liquid when Mainnet launches. The remaining amount will vest over the coming years and be used to distribute future staking rewards. SUI will be used to participate in the PoS consensus through delegating and earning rewards. The token will also grant the delegator the right to vote or propose on-chain protocol upgrades via governance.\n\nToken Distribution:\n\n‍\n\nThe diagram above shows the token distribution for the SUI token.\n\n50% of the total supply will be allocated to the community reserve which entails:\n\nDelegation program: The foundation to help bootstrap community run validators and ensure even stake distribution across the network.\n\nGrant Program: This is meant for the developers and other participants to encourage building on Sui.\n\nResearch and Development: The foundation will use these tokens to invest into further development of the protocol.\n\nValidator Subsidies: These will be used to subsidize staking rewards in the early stages of the network.&nbsp;\n\n20% is allocated to early contributors\n\n14% will be distributed to Investors\n\n10% is reserved for the Mysten Labs Treasury\n\nLastly, 6% will be for the Community Access Program and App Testers. You can read more about the Access Program here.\n\n‍\n\nGas Fees\n\nSui’s gas fee structure is aimed to create a credible anchor for users to eliminate uncertainty when submitting transactions. Validators coordinate at the beginning of each epoch and set a reference price allowing users to have a credible citation mark when deciphering gas prices. By incentivizing validators who disclose their accurate reservation prices users can credibly presume that transactions will be processed in a punctual manner. The reference price is fixed for the duration of the epoch, however, users can “tip” or reduce the price as long as it is above the gas price floor, which is updated periodically depending on network activity. Therefore, the more validators on the network, the lower the price.\n\nReference Price: at the beginning of each epoch, a validator wide survey is conducted and each validator submits a minimum price at which they are willing to process transactions. Out of the submitted prices, the protocol chooses the average minimum price to set as the reference price for gas fees. You can read more about the reference price mechanism here.\n\nStorage gas price: this refers to the cost of accommodating one unit of storage and is measured in SUI. This is decided through governance and is rarely changed. Storage gas price remains unchanged every epoch and is the same for all transactions.\n\nSui Storage Fund\n\nIn order to offset costs of large amounts of on-chain data Sui uses a Storage fund. The fund is designed to redistribute storage fees collected over time. When submitting a transaction, users pay both the computation fee as well as the storage fee. The collected funds are distributed to new validators to combat the cost of large data storage.\n\nThere are 3 main features of the Storage fund:\n\nFunded by past transactions: the Storage Fund is funded by users who are creating on-chain data and compensates future validators for the extensive storage needed when entering the ecosystem.\n\nOnly pays out from returns: Validators are able to borrow additional stake to bootstrap their node and meet the minimum stake requirements when initially starting out. To repay the funds they get to keep a certain percentage of the rewards and the remaining rewards from the borrowed stake are deposited back into the storage fund. Storage fund only pays out from the returns on its capital and does not distribute the principal accrued over time.\n\nDeletion Option: Once data is deleted from of on-chain storage, users gain a Storage fee rebate. The theory behind is that if the deleted data is no longer on-chain, there is no point in paying for storage fees. It is to be kept in mind that this does not refer to transactions, rather points at data such as NFT metadata, auctions, tickets etc.&nbsp;\n\nThe Storage fund reduces the barriers to entry into the Sui ecosystem and encourages new validators to join.\n\n‍\n\nDelegated Proof of Stake\n\nThe Sui blockchain relies on a Delegated Proof-of-Stake mechanism (DPoS) which allows SUI token holders to delegate their tokens to any validator of choice. Total stake delegated to a validator is in direct relation to the validators voting power. Once delegated, SUI tokens are locked for the entire epoch and are free to change the delegated validator once the epoch changes.\n\n‍\n\nRewards\n\nIn light of the PoS system, SUI holders who delegate their tokens to validators will earn rewards for securing the network. Rewards are distributed at the end of each epoch and are derived from transaction fees aka gas fees.\n\n‍\n\nFuture Developments&nbsp;\n\nPrior to mainnet launch, Sui will run a private testnet consisting of three waves. Each wave will test a different functionality of the network. Sui has just recently launched the first wave of their Testnet. With each wave, more validators will be onboarded to eventually test the network at full capacity to prepare for mainnet. Upon mainnet Sui will launch with a delegated proof of stake mechanism which will allow users to stake their SUI tokens immediately. A diagram explaining the roadmap can be found below.

Learn how to buy SUI and stake SUI using Trust Wallet.\n\nSui is a cutting-edge Layer 1 blockchain designed for unmatched scalability and speed, aiming to transform how decentralized applications (dApps) operate. At the heart of the Sui Network is the SUI token, which fuels everything from governance to transaction processing and staking. Whether you're looking to invest, stake, or actively participate in the ecosystem, understanding SUI's tokenomics and functionality is important.\n\nIn this guide, we'll cover the fundamentals of the Sui ecosystem, explore how to buy SUI and stake SUI using Trust Wallet, and highlight its recent market performance, including its all-time high (ATH).\n\nBuy SUI\n\nstrong]:!font-bold\" id=\"overview-of-sui-ecosystem\">Overview of Sui Ecosystem\n\nThe Sui ecosystem is built to support a diverse range of decentralized applications (dApps) while ensuring high transaction throughput and low latency. Here’s a closer look at the key components that make up this innovative ecosystem:\n\nLayer 1 Blockchain\n\nSUI operates as a Layer 1 blockchain, meaning it has its own independent network that processes transactions, without relying on other blockchains. This design enables greater flexibility and scalability, making it an ideal platform for developers looking to build high-performance applications.\n\nCore Participants\n\nThe Sui ecosystem is comprised of several key participants, each playing an important role in its functionality:\n\nUsers\n\nIndividuals who interact with dApps built on the SUI blockchain can access various services, including finance, gaming, and social networking. Users can utilize SUI tokens for transactions, governance, and staking.\n\nValidators\n\nThese are nodes that maintain the network's integrity by validating transactions and securing the blockchain. Validators play a key role in ensuring the reliability and security of the Sui ecosystem. In return for their services, validators earn rewards paid in SUI tokens.\n\nSUI Token Holders\n\nPeople who hold SUI tokens can actively participate in governance decisions affecting the network. This includes voting on proposals related to upgrades, changes in protocol, and other important matters. Additionally, token holders can stake assets to earn rewards, further incentivizing participation in the ecosystem.\n\nstrong]:!font-bold\" id=\"sui-tokenomics\">SUI Tokenomics\n\nUnderstanding the tokenomics of SUI is important for grasping how the ecosystem functions and how the SUI token can be utilized effectively.\n\nThe total supply of SUI tokens is capped at 10 billion tokens. This fixed supply is designed to create scarcity and value over time, ensuring that the token remains a valuable asset within the ecosystem. The distribution of SUI is as follows:\n\n20% for Early Contributors.\n\n14% for Investors.\n\n10% for the Treasury.\n\n6% for Community Access Program and App Testers.\n\n50% for Community Reserve.\n\nstrong]:!font-bold\" id=\"use-cases-of-sui-token\">Use Cases of SUI Token\n\nThe SUI token serves several critical functions within the ecosystem:\n\nGas Fees\n\nSUI tokens are used to pay for transaction fees on the network. You must hold and use SUI tokens to execute smart contracts and interact with dApps, making it a fundamental component of the blockchain’s operation.\n\nStaking Rewards\n\nAs a token holder, you can stake your SUI tokens to earn rewards. When you participate in staking, you contribute to the network's security and stability, while receiving a portion of the transaction fees generated on the platform.\n\nOn-chain Voting\n\nIf you hold SUI tokens, you have governance rights, enabling you to vote on proposals that impact the future direction of the network. This decentralized governance model ensures that decisions reflect the collective interests of the community.\n\nNFTs and DeFi Projects\n\nThe SUI token facilitates transactions within various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces built on the platform. This versatility enhances its utility and encourages broader adoption.\n\nstrong]:!font-bold\" id=\"sui-recent-all-time-high-(ath)\">SUI Recent All-Time High (ATH)\n\nThe SUI token recently reached a significant milestone, achieving an all-time high (ATH) of $2.36 on October 14, 2024. This remarkable price surge reflects a strong upward trend in the token's value, which has seen substantial growth over the past few months. Following this peak, the token's price has shown resilience, maintaining a position above $2, indicating market interest and investor confidence.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to the recent surge in SUI's price:\n\nIncreased adoption: The Sui blockchain has been gaining traction in the Layer 1 space, attracting developers and users. This increased adoption has led to higher demand for the SUI token as more applications and services are built on the platform.\n\nMarket capitalization growth: As of mid-October 2024, SUI's market capitalization has entered the top 20 cryptocurrencies, further enhancing its visibility and appeal to investors.\n\nEcosystem developments: The launch of key DeFi applications and partnerships within the Sui ecosystem has spurred interest. For instance, the introduction of native USDC on the Sui Network has positioned it as a competitive player in decentralized finance.\n\nCapital flow from competitors: Notably, there has been a shift of capital from competitors like Solana to Sui, with reports indicating that nearly 27% of funds that exited Solana have moved to Sui.

It can support a wide range of application development with unrivaled speed at low cost.\n\nSui’s Key\nTechnical Innovations\n\nObject-Centric Design\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks\nTransaction Processing\nHorizontal Scalability\nMove\n\nObject-centric Design\nSui uses objects as its basic unit of data storage rather than accounts, as happens on most other blockchains. Developers define, create, and manage these programmable objects that represent user-level assets. An object has distinct attributes, including ownership, whose values can be updated based on the governing logic of the smart contract that created it.\n\nAlthough a smart contract creates an object, it does not store the object. Objects and their attributes are stored directly on-chain.\nOwned objects vs shared objects\nMost assets on Sui are owned by a single address, recorded as a data value for the object. These are referred to as “owned objects.” Transferring ownership simply requires a change of that value. Transactions that are independent of any other action being performed on the network, such as an asset transfer, are considered simple or “single-writer” transactions and can be processed without going through consensus.\n\nSome assets have shared ownership, meaning multiple accounts must authenticate a transaction that changes data related to the object. These transactions are considered complex and must be validated through consensus.\nComposable objects\nNot only can a person own an object, but objects can own objects on Sui, allowing them to combine into a whole new asset, which is often referred to as composable assets.\nLearn More\n\nFirst of Its Kind Composable Transaction\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks are one of Sui’s most powerful core developer primitives. For conventional blockchains, the fundamental unit of execution is a transaction which is typically simplistic and close to the virtual machine (VM) execution. On Sui, the fundamental unit of execution is elevated to the level of a complex, composable sequence of transactions.\nUnbounded Expressivity\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks are heterogeneous and can access any public on-chain Move function across all smart contracts. Within a single Programmable Transaction Block, typed outputs from earlier on-chain Move calls can be chained as typed inputs to later on-chain Move calls. These types can be arbitrary Sui objects that carry a rich set of attributes and properties. A single Programmable Transaction Block can extract a Player object from a smart contract wallet, use it to make a move in a Game, then send a Badge object won by the move to a multi-game TrophyCase, all without publishing any new smart contract code. There can be up to 1024 heterogeneous transactions in a single Programmable Transaction Block, making its compositionality nearly unbounded.\n\nAtomic Guarantee\nChained transactions in a Programmable Transaction Block execute and fail atomically, meaning they can not be partially processed. This provides a convenient and intuitive programming model, as well as strong guarantees for payment or finance oriented applications.\nCoin Management Simplified\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks leverage gas smashing to simplify coin management. Dust coins, remainder amounts of negligible value, are merged at the end of execution before transaction results are returned.\nLearn More\n\nParallel Processing of Simple Transactions\nMost blockchain transactions are simple transactions, such as asset transfers, peer-to-peer payments, and minting NFTs. As each simple transaction is independent, they do not need to be completed in any particular order. Rather, they can be processed in parallel.\n\nSui is designed to optimize for these common, simple transactions. On other blockchains, every transaction, no matter what it is, must enter into a total-ordered list and be verified and processed through global consensus. This typical design can create a bottleneck in the network, reducing the processing speed of individual transactions (latency) and the total number of transactions that can be processed at a time (throughput).\n\nSui uses an algorithm known as “Byzantine Consistent Broadcast” to reduce the bottleneck and maintain low latency and high throughput. A requestor or proxy can proactively talk to validators to facilitate processing without consensus, resulting in near-instant finality without diminished security. This enables parallel transaction submission and execution on a massive scale.\nNarwhal and Bullshark Consensus Engine for Complex Transactions\nComplex transactions must be sequenced and go through consensus to be finalized. On Sui, the consensus engine consists of two parts, Narwhal and Tusk. Narwhal is the holding pen for transactions (mempool) that ensures the data is available for processing by the validators. Tusk is the mechanism by which all transactions involving shared objects are ordered.Some assets have shared ownership, meaning multiple accounts must authenticate a transaction that changes data related to the object. These transactions are considered complex and must be validated through consensus.\nLearn More\n\nHorizontal Scalability\nSui scales horizontally to meet increased network demand on the network. Validators can add more computing power to increase their performance as needed, and reduce it when not needed. Even with high network traffic, Sui's tokenomics model is designed to keep gas fees low and stable. Validators are incentivized to add this capacity because they earn more gas fees instead of higher fees.\n\nSui's scalability is not limited to transaction processing. Storage is also low-cost and horizontally scalable. This enables developers to define complex assets with rich attributes that live directly on-chain instead of introducing layers of indirection into off-chain storage to save on gas fees.\n\nMove\nMove is the native programming language for Sui. It was designed to incorporate everything a blockchain developer would need to create performant, secure, feature-rich applications.\n\nMove is based on the Move language which was specifically designed to improve upon flaws in other smart contract programming languages. Move addresses two key issues in smart contract design: representation of digital assets and safe operations over them. Move has first-class abstractions of assets and access control that improve both the safety of smart contracts and the productivity of smart contract programmers. Move builds on this achievement and adds language for blockchain-specific concepts such as accounts, transactions, time, and cryptography.\nLearn More\n\nOther Important\nFeatures of Sui\n\nDynamic Fields\nDynamic fields allow greater flexibility for builders as they don’t only have to define fields as fixed types. These fields have arbitrary names and can be added and removed ad hoc. Dynamic fields also support heterogeneous types, making it possible to store un-like types within a certain object.\n\nRandomness\nVarious applications, such as games, make use of randomly generated numbers. Truly random numbers are important to ensure fair outcomes for app users. Sui supports the League of Entropy’s drand beacon, which delivers unbiased random numbers.\n\nPackage Upgrades\nSui smart contracts are represented by immutable package objects consisting of a collection of Move modules. Because builders require the ability to update their code and pull changes from other developers, the Sui network provides a method of upgrading packages while still retaining their immutable properties.\n\nSponsored Transactions\nTo process a transaction on Sui, a user must pay a gas fee. However, many users new to blockchains are unfamiliar with this concept and it can be a barrier to completing their transaction. To remove the friction of asking the user to pay the fee, sponsored transactions, enabled through gas stations, let the application pay the fee itself, never needing to reveal its existence to the user.\n\nDisplay Standard\nThe Sui Object Display standard is a template engine that allows for the on-chain management of how an object displays off-chain. Display makes it possible to leave an interface unchanged while updating connected objects, eliminating extra gas fees. Of course, the Display Object can be updated as well. For example, a game might allow an item such as a sword to be upgraded. In this case, the Display Object for the sword might change.\n\nKiosk Standard\nKiosk is a primitive for building open, zero-fee trading platforms with a high degree of customization over transfer policies. It allows creators to issue policies with objects that give them the power to enforce any constraint on trades they desire, including royalty policies when an object is sold.\n\nZero Knowledge Proofs\nSui supports zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) as part of its cryptographic model. ZKP allows one party in a two-party transaction to accept a statement from the other party as true without needing additional information about the other party’s veracity.\n\nAdvanced Cryptography\nSui uses a multitude of major cryptography advancements to ensure the utmost level of security on the chain. These include attributes that allow developers to implement policy based key management without complex cryptography, enable verifiable randomness APIs, and faster proof verification.\n\nzkLogin\nWith native supports for the OpenID Connect standard, users can create on-chain accounts with their existing web2 services that supports OpenID Connect such as Google, GitHub, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, and many other. This means users will be able to access Sui without the need of private keys or mnemonics streamlining user onboarding at scale.\n\nSui makes efficient use of ZKPs over OpenID payloads to protect user privacy\nLearn More\n\nSui’s Key Economic Innovations\n\nSui Economy’s Participants\n\nThe Sui economy has three main sets of participants:&nbsp;\nusers who submit transactions to the platform to create, change, or transfer digital assets or interact with applications built on Sui\nSUI token holders who either stake their funds to validators in order to secure the network and participate in governance or use them to pay fees to interact with assets and applications on the chain\nvalidators who manage transaction processing and execution\nThese participants interact with each other in a variety of ways across the network and that interplay informs the three core components of Sui’s tokenomics:&nbsp;\nSui’s Proof-of-Stake Mechanism ensures the incentives of SUI token holders are in line with Sui’s validators\nSui’s Gas Mechanism ensures the network charges low and stable gas fees to users no matter how much demand there is for activity on the network\nSui’s Storage Fund ensures data storage is priced accurately so data stored today doesn’t burden future users of the network\nAnd the glue that holds the whole system together is the SUI token, Sui’s native asset.\n\nThe SUI Token\n\nSUI tokens serve four purposes on the network:\nThey can be staked to a validator in order to secure the network and earn stake rewards.&nbsp;\nThey can be used to pay gas fees to execute transactions and other operations.&nbsp;\nThey act as the native asset to facilitate on-chain transactions underpinning the whole Sui economy.\nThey give holders the right to participate in future governance.&nbsp;\nThe total supply of SUI is capped at 10 billion tokens.\n\nSui’s Use of Delegated Proof-of-Stake\n\nWithin each epoch, a fixed set of validators are responsible for operating the network. This set is chosen based on the amount of SUI tokens staked to the validator. With Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), Sui allows for the broadest possible participation of token holders in network operations. Importantly, by using staked SUI token amounts as a proxy for voting power, the right degree of “skin in the game” is established—those who care most about the network’s future get a larger voice in its current operations.\n\nMost SUI token holders will not have the funds, ability, or desire to run a validator but want to participate in securing the network. To do so, they “back” a validator they believe to be a good actor by delegating their tokens to that validator’s stake. These delegated tokens help the validator reach the minimum amount needed to be part of the active set of validators for the epoch. The tokens are locked for the epoch, meaning they can’t be transferred or sold.&nbsp;\n\nIn exchange for operating and securing the network, the validator receives staking rewards in the form of SUI tokens. The rewards are distributed to all token holders who delegated to that validator’s stake, minus a small commission fee paid to the manager of the validator.\n\nSui’s Gas Pricing Mechanism\n\nSui’s gas pricing mechanism achieves several important outcomes:&nbsp;\ndelivering users with low, predictable transaction fees\nincentivizing validators to optimize their transaction processing operations;&nbsp;\npreventing spam and denial of service attacks.\nSui can deliver predictable transaction fees because validators agree via survey on a network-wide reference price at the start of each epoch. Validators each state the minimum price they would be willing to take to process a transaction. These prices are ordered by the protocol and a reference price is selected at which a quorum of validators necessary to run the network are willing to promptly process transactions.&nbsp;\n\nValidators are incentivized to propose credible prices since the network uses the Tallying Rule to determine which validators are processing transactions at the current gas price. Validators evaluate one another’s performance during the epoch, establishing a multiplier for the stake rewards of other validators. If a validator is slow or non-performant, then the Tallying Rule can be used to slash that validator’s rewards. The Tallying Rule’s thus creates a community-enforced mechanism for encouraging validators to honor the reference gas price.\n\nUnlike gas fees, storage fees are set through governance proposals to stay on par with the cost of off-chain data storage. As the costs of off-chain storage declines over time, governance proposals will update Sui’s on-chain storage fees to reflect the new target price.\n\nSui’s Storage Fund\n\nA blockchain network is not static. The validators who write transactions to the chain today may not be the same as those who will store the data in the future. Because the amount of data grows over time, if users only paid the fees needed at the time of a transaction, future users would pay disproportionately high fees, discouraging use of the network.\n\nTo solve this problem, Sui’s Storage Fund redistributes past transaction fees to future validators. Users pay upfront for processing and storage and the storage fees are deposited in the Storage Fund. These funds are considered when distributing stake rewards and are used to adjust the share of rewards distributed to validators. If storage requirements are high, validators receive additional stake rewards to cover additional costs, and vice versa when requirements are low. This ensures that validators are adequately compensated for their costs of holding data in storage.\n\nSui’s storage model also has a “delete option” by which users can obtain a storage fee rebate when they delete previously stored on-chain data. It is expected that users will delete data whenever storage no longer makes financial sense, preventing unending growth of storage needs. Sui thus offers the best of both worlds: the ability for users to store on-chain data while incorporating a market mechanism ensuring that only data that is worth storing is actually kept on Sui.\n\nA Note on Governance\nEventually, protocol upgrades and other Sui governance changes will be passed through on-chain voting proposals. The SUI token will give any token holder the ability to participate in this process by staking to a validator. In that way, the future decisions of the network are controlled by the decentralized community.\n\nLearn\nIntroduction to SuiMoveUse casesBTCfi on SuiResearchNetwork statusNetwork informationToken schedule\nBuild\nDeveloper portalDocsCoursesRequest for proposalsTutorialsGithubWhitepaperDeveloper forum\nConnect\nEventsCommunity programsJob boardDirectorySui University Initiative\nAbout\nSecuritySui FoundationCareersPress centerMedia kitBlogTrademark PolicyBug Bounty ProgramPrivacy Policy\n\n©2025 Copyright Sui Foundation.

Review on SUI in  2025\n\nJoin the Most Active Community of Traders Today !\n\nWhat is SUI ?\n\nSUI is the native token of the blockchain of the same name. The crypto positions itself as a layer 1 comparable to Ethereum, enabling the development of decentralized applications (dApps). In a highly competitive sector, SUI distinguishes itself through advanced technical characteristics that allow it to compete with other “Ethereum killers” like Solana, Cardano or Avalanche.\n\nThe SUI blockchain was designed to address the fundamental challenges of the blockchain trilemma: scalability, decentralization, and security. Its uniqueness lies in its innovative architecture that provides exceptional performance, particularly in terms of transaction speed and processing capacity.\n\nThe History of SUI\n\nThe project’s history is closely tied to that of the social media giant Meta (formerly Facebook). The SUI token was officially launched on May 2, 2023, by Mysten Labs, a company founded by former Meta developers.\n\nThis connection with Meta is not coincidental. In 2019, the group led by Mark Zuckerberg attempted to launch its own cryptocurrency called Libra. After several twists and a name change to Diem, the project was eventually abandoned. That’s when part of the team decided to continue the blockchain adventure by creating Mysten Labs and developing the blockchain.\n\nThe project quickly attracted interest from top-tier investors. Among SUI’s partners and supporters are major players in the crypto ecosystem such as Circle (issuer of USDC) and Binance Labs, the investment arm of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIn 2024, the token reached a decisive milestone with the deployment of Mysticeti, a major improvement to its consensus that significantly enhanced its performance. This update propelled SUI among the fastest blockchains in the world, capable of executing transactions in less than a second.\n\nWho Created SUI ?\n\nMysten Labs, the company behind this project, was founded by a team of blockchain and cryptography experts. The main founders are former Meta developers.\n\nAmong the key figures at Mysten Labs is Adeniyi Abiodun, co-founder of the company, who formulated an ambitious vision for this protocol: “SUI is not just a blockchain; it’s a global coordination layer for the Internet.”\n\nThe Mysten Labs team benefits from solid expertise in blockchain technology development and distributed systems. This experience has allowed them to design a unique architecture that addresses the limitations of existing blockchains.\n\nThe SUI Foundation, meanwhile, plays a crucial role in developing the ecosystem. It actively supports developers and projects building on the blockchain, while promoting the adoption of the technology globally.\n\nDiscover SUI on Bitget – Buy easily and quickly !\n\nWhat is SUI Crypto Used For ?\n\nThe token fulfills several essential functions within the SUI blockchain ecosystem :\n\nFirst, SUI serves as a means of payment for transaction fees on the network. Each operation performed on the SUI blockchain requires the payment of fees in SUI tokens, which creates a constant demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nSecond, it’s a governance token that allows its holders to participate in decisions regarding the evolution of the protocol. Token holders can vote on improvement proposals and thus influence the future direction of the project.\n\nThird, the token can be used for staking, a process that involves locking up tokens to secure the network and receive rewards in return. Staking SUI offers investors a source of passive income while contributing to the security and decentralization of the network.\n\nFinally, it facilitates the development of decentralized applications (dApps) in various domains such as decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, blockchain games, and many others. The SUI blockchain is particularly suited for applications requiring high processing speed and low latency.\n\nBy 2025, the SUI ecosystem has significantly expanded with numerous protocols contributing to its growth. Among them are DeepBook (liquidity infrastructure), Walrus (decentralized storage solution), as well as DeFi projects like Bluefin, Suilend, Cetus, Scallop, and Momentum.\n\nHow Does the SUI Network Work ?\n\nThe blockchain specific to the project distinguishes itself through its innovative architecture that provides exceptional performance. Unlike many traditional blockchains, it uses an approach that allows for horizontal scalability, meaning the ability to increase performance simply by adding more resources.\n\nThe Architecture of the SUI Blockchain\n\nOne of the main innovations of SUI lies in its ability to process transactions in parallel. While many blockchains process transactions sequentially, SUI can execute independent transactions simultaneously, which significantly increases its throughput.\n\nTo achieve this remarkable performance, SUI relies on two innovative systems :\n\nThe Narwhal mempool protocol based on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): this system efficiently organizes transactions before validation.\n\nThe Tusk consensus algorithm: this algorithm ensures transaction finality while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.\n\nThanks to this unique architecture, SUI can theoretically achieve scalability exceeding 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). By comparison, Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain for decentralized applications, caps at around 15 TPS.\n\nIn  2025, the deployment of Mysticeti further improved these performances, making SUI one of the fastest blockchains in the world. This update enabled executing transactions and swaps in less than a second, offering a user experience close to that of traditional financial systems.\n\nThe Move Programming Language\n\nSUI uses a programming language called Move for smart contract development. This language, initially developed for Meta’s Libra/Diem project, offers several significant advantages:\n\nMove is an open-source language specially designed for blockchain applications. It emphasizes code security and verifiability, two crucial aspects in developing decentralized applications.\n\nOne of Move’s distinctive characteristics is its resistance to “reentrancy” attacks, which have affected other blockchains like Ethereum. This resistance is ensured by a rigorous system and formal verification mechanisms.\n\nThe combination of these characteristics makes SUI a platform particularly suited for developing decentralized financial applications requiring a high level of security.\n\nBuy SUI at low fees on Bitget now !\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of SUI\n\nLike any blockchain technology, this protocol has advantages and disadvantages that should be analyzed to understand its potential and limitations.\n\nThe Advantages\n\nExceptional scalability : With a theoretical capacity exceeding 100,000 TPS, SUI positions itself among the most performant blockchains in the market. This scalability allows it to support a large number of users and applications without compromising performance.\n\nLow latency : Thanks to its parallel architecture and the Mysticeti improvement, it offers extremely fast transaction confirmation times, often less than a second. This characteristic is particularly appreciated for applications requiring immediate responsiveness, such as games or trading platforms.\n\nEnhanced security : The Move programming language, used for development on SUI, offers security guarantees superior to those of many other smart contract languages. Its resistance to reentrancy attacks and its technical approach significantly reduce the risks of bugs and vulnerabilities.\n\nGrowing ecosystem : By 2025, the SUI ecosystem has significantly expanded with numerous protocols and applications in various domains. This diversity creates a dynamic environment conducive to innovation and adoption.\n\nInstitutional support : The crypto benefits from the support of renowned investors and partners, which strengthens its credibility and long-term growth potential. The growing interest of traditional financial institutions in SUI demonstrates its maturity and potential.\n\nThe Disadvantages\n\nFierce competition : SUI operates in a highly competitive sector, where numerous blockchains compete for the position of alternative to Ethereum. This competition could limit its growth and long-term adoption.\n\nRelative youth : Launched in 2023, SUI is still a relatively young blockchain compared to established projects like Ethereum or Bitcoin. This youth implies a less mature ecosystem and potentially more risks for developers and users.\n\nPotential centralization : Like many new-generation blockchains prioritizing performance, SUI could face criticism regarding its level of decentralization. The compromise between performance and decentralization is a constant challenge in the blockchain industry.\n\nLimited adoption : Despite its rapid recent growth, the adoption of SUI remains limited compared to leading market blockchains. Increasing its adoption will depend on its ability to attract more developers and users.\n\nPrice volatility : Like all cryptocurrencies, the SUI token is subject to high volatility, which can constitute a risk for investors and limit its use as a stable means of payment.\n\nSUI Price and Predictions\n\nThe journey of the SUI token since its launch has been marked by significant fluctuations, reflecting both the project’s potential and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHistorical Price Evolution\n\nAt its launch in May 2023, the SUI token was trading around $1.30. After a month of relative stability, the price entered a downward phase, reaching its all-time low on October 19, 2023, at $0.36.\n\nHowever, since this low point, the trend has reversed and the token has experienced remarkable progress. As of mid-May 2025, the SUI price is around $3.49, representing a 10-fold increase from its all-time low. Its all-time high is at $5.35.\n\nThis progression is explained by several factors, notably the successful deployment of Mysticeti in 2024, the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem on SUI, and the growing interest of institutional investors in the project.\n\nIn  2025, the market capitalization of the crypto now exceeds $12 billion, placing the cryptocurrency in the global top 15, testifying to its rapid progression in the cryptocurrency ranking.\n\nPrice Predictions for 2025, 2030, and 2050\n\nAnalysts are generally optimistic about the future price of SUI, although their forecasts vary considerably.\n\nAccording to Coinedition, the crypto’s price could reach $5.35 by the end of 2025, then $14.84 in 2030 and potentially $48.65 in 2050. These long-term projections reflect confidence in the project’s viability and continued growth.\n\nMore recently, according to a Tronweekly article published in May 2025, the crypto could potentially reach $8.31 by the end of 2025, driven by a bullish technical dynamic and a significant increase in trading volumes.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that these predictions should be taken with a grain of salt. They are by no means in-depth analyses, and we always encourage you to do your own research. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile and unpredictable, and many external factors can influence the evolution of the SUI price.\n\nKey Moments in the History of SUI\n\nSince its launch, the SUI blockchain has experienced several key moments that have shaped its development and adoption.\n\nMay 2023 : Official launch of the SUI token by Mysten Labs.

Mini Tutorial\n\nHere’s how to buy the crypto in 5 steps on the best platform in our ranking.\n\nCreate an account on Bitget :\n\nGo to the official website\n\nClick on “Sign Up”\n\nFill out the form with your email and password\n\nComplete the KYC :\n\nPrepare a valid ID document\n\nFollow the verification instructions\n\nDeposit funds :\n\nFund your account on the platform. Via bank transfer, credit card, or other cryptocurrencies for example.\n\nBuy SUI :\n\nNavigate to “Spot Trading”\n\nSearch for the SUI/USDT or SUI/EUR pair\n\nPlace a buy order by specifying the quantity of crypto you want to acquire or the amount you want to spend.\n\nYou can generally choose between a market order (purchase at the current price) or a limit order (purchase at a specific price you define).\n\nSecure your SUI tokens :\n\nAfter purchase, it is strongly recommended to transfer your tokens from the exchange platform to a secure personal wallet (see next section) to have total control over them.\n\nChoose a platform that matches your needs in terms of fees, security, ease of use, and regulatory compliance in your jurisdiction.\n\nBuy SUI with ease on Bitget !\n\nHow to Store SUI ?\n\nOnce you have acquired tokens, the question of their secure storage becomes paramount. Leaving your cryptocurrencies on an exchange platform (CEX) involves significant risks: you don’t directly control your private keys, and your funds could be lost in case of platform hacking, regulatory issues, or company bankruptcy.\n\nThis is why it is strongly recommended to transfer your SUI to a personal wallet for which you alone hold the private keys. “Not your keys, not your coins“.\n\nThere are mainly two types of wallets for storing your SUI:\n\nCold Wallets : These are hardware devices that store your private keys offline, thus offering the highest level of security against online hacking. They often resemble secure USB keys. Recognized brands like Ledger (for example, Ledger Nano S Plus or Ledger Nano X) are the safest solutions for storing significant amounts or for long-term storage.\n\nHot Wallets : These are software (mobile or desktop applications, browser extensions) that store your private keys on a device connected to the Internet. They are more convenient for frequent use and for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps), but are inherently more vulnerable to malware and phishing than cold wallets. Popular wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet can be configured to manage SUI tokens.\n\nThe choice between a cold wallet and a hot wallet depends on your specific needs: prioritize a cold wallet (like Ledger) for maximum security of your main investments, and possibly use a hot wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet) for smaller amounts intended for regular interactions with the SUI DeFi ecosystem. The essential thing is to always carefully secure your recovery phrase (seed phrase) and never share it or store it digitally.\n\nYour SUI, secure on Ledger !\n\nHow to Get SUI for Free ?\n\nObtaining tokens for free is possible through several methods, although the amounts are generally limited.\n\n“Faucets” are websites that distribute small amounts of cryptocurrencies for free. Several faucets dedicated to SUI exist, allowing users to receive a small quantity of tokens in exchange for completing simple tasks like solving captchas or viewing advertisements.\n\nThe SUI Foundation and projects built on the SUI blockchain regularly organize reward programs and airdrops to promote adoption of the ecosystem. These initiatives can take several forms, such as testnet programs, project airdrops, referral programs, or Learn-to-Earn campaigns.\n\nAlthough staking is not strictly speaking a method to obtain the crypto for free (since it requires already owning tokens), it nevertheless constitutes a way to increase your position in SUI without additional investment. In  2025, staking SUI offers an average annual yield of about 3 to 5%, depending on market conditions and the chosen validator.\n\nIt’s important to note that these methods generally do not allow obtaining significant quantities of SUI and should not be considered as an alternative to traditional investment if you wish to take a significant position.\n\nIs SUI Legal ?\n\nThe legality of the crypto varies considerably depending on jurisdictions, as with all cryptocurrencies. In the European Union, the crypto is legal and regulated by the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation that came into force in  2025, which provides a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-assets across all member countries.\n\nIn the United States, SUI is generally considered legal, with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) not having classified it as a “security”. This recognition allows SUI to be traded on major American platforms like Coinbase, and the growing interest of American financial institutions testifies to its integration into the regulatory framework.\n\nIn Asia, the situation is more contrasted: the crypto is legal in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, but banned in China where all cryptocurrency transactions have been prohibited since 2021. In most developed countries, the crypto is legal, although often subject to specific tax obligations.\n\nTaxation Related to Capital Gains\n\nTax implications also vary by country. In France, capital gains realized when selling SUI are subject to the 30% “flat tax”, while in the United States, SUI is considered property by the IRS, with variable tax rates depending on the holding period. It is strongly recommended to consult a tax advisor familiar with cryptocurrencies to precisely understand your obligations in your jurisdiction.\n\nWho Holds the Most SUI ?\n\nMysten Labs, as the creator of the blockchain, holds a significant share of the tokens, estimated at about 10% of the total supply. This allocation helps fund the continuous development of the technology and ecosystem, thus ensuring the project’s long-term sustainability.\n\nThe SUI Foundation, a non-profit organization responsible for promoting and developing the ecosystem, also owns about 5% of the total supply. These tokens are primarily intended to fund developer grants, community initiatives, and global adoption programs.\n\nSeveral venture capital funds and companies have invested in the crypto during private funding rounds, including Binance Labs, Circle Ventures, a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), and Jump Crypto. Their participation testifies to institutional investors’ confidence in the long-term potential of the crypto.\n\nWith the development of investment products like the Grayscale SUI Trust and potential ETFs under evaluation, a growing share of tokens is now held by these investment vehicles, facilitating traditional investors’ access to this asset class. This evolution contributes to a wider distribution of tokens and a progressive decentralization of the network.\n\nReview on SUI in  2025\n\nIn  2025, the crypto has established itself as one of the most innovative blockchain projects in the crypto market. Its cutting-edge technology, combining a unique parallel architecture and the Move programming language, gives it a significant competitive advantage in terms of performance and security.\n\nThe ecosystem that has developed around the crypto is particularly dynamic, with a TVL exceeding $4 billion and applications in various domains such as DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain games. This diversity testifies to the platform’s versatility and its ability to attract talented developers, a key success factor in the blockchain industry.\n\nThe growing interest of traditional financial institutions in SUI, illustrated by ETF applications and strategic partnerships with leading asset managers, also constitutes a strong signal of the project’s maturity and credibility. This institutional recognition, combined with exceptional technical performance, positions SUI as an essential player in Web3 for years to come. Our opinion is therefore globally positive.\n\nSUI at your fingertips on Bitget!\n\nKevin\n\nAvec une formation en ingénierie mécanique et en gestion de projets, j'ai travaillé dans l'industrie automobile et nucléaire pendant 10 ans.

While both ecosystems are compelling, they represent earlier generations of blockchain technology. Since their inception, newer blockchains have emerged to address the limitations of these systems. Among these are Aptos and Sui, two related blockchains founded by the diaspora of Facebook’s blockchain project, Diem. Diem aimed to create a stablecoin payment system for Facebook’s social media platform but was shelved due to regulatory pressure. However, its experiments spurred significant advancements in blockchain&nbsp;technology.\n\nOne of the most important outputs of Diem was the Move smart contract programming language. Move is based off the popular (+4.3M developers worldwide, 3rd fastest growing language) Rust language and was optimized to solve issues with earlier smart contract languages like Ethereum’s Solidity and Cardano’s Haskell. Both Aptos and Sui leverage Move to create a quicker, safer, and more intuitive development environment for software engineers to build applications out of smart contracts. Move also helps the underlying engine of both Aptos and Sui, called “the virtual machine” (VM), process transactions faster (how quickly a user receives a confirmation) and with more throughput (how many transactions the system can process per time period). Move's potential is so high that the value of all Move-based blockchains has surged from ~$5B to ~$22B in just one&nbsp;year.\n\nSui and Aptos: Origins and Overview\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Blockchain Performance and Scalability\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Ecosystems\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Trading Experience\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Tokenomics\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Our Valuation\n\nSui and Aptos: Price Prediction for 2025\n\nSui and Aptos: Conclusion and Investment Risks\n\nCrypto has 1/1000th the Developer Community of&nbsp;JavaScript\n\nSource: Electric Capital, Slash Data as of 12/19/2024.\n\nMove is important because it offers a better entry point for incoming developers. The number of crypto developers is very small, and a popular quip is that there are more full-time developers at Meta (Facebook) than there are in all of crypto. By offering a more approachable and efficient language, Move has the potential to attract a broader developer base, fostering experimentation and innovation. This is vital for uncovering the next groundbreaking application that could drive mass adoption. We view blockchains as a platform for innovation and experimentation, with high valuations of SCPs driven by their capacity to enable groundbreaking applications that can engage hundreds of millions of users. Because no one knows what that application may be, it is important to have as many people experimenting as&nbsp;possible.\n\nBoth Sui and Aptos pair their Move VMs with advanced consensus mechanisms that ensure each network efficiently validates transactions and updates. This combination of cutting-edge virtual machines and consensus protocols forms the foundation of their technology, delivering superior performance compared to previous blockchain systems. Until innovations like Solana’s Firedancer prove otherwise, Sui and Aptos stand as the pinnacle of blockchain&nbsp;technology.\n\nAptos Achieved 326M or 13.3K Transactions Per Second (TPS) on 10/18/2024\n\nPeak daily transactions of different blockchains. Source: Artemis XYZ as of 12/19/2024.\n\nSui and Aptos offer important blockchain technology capable of serving hundreds of millions of users. Aptos and Sui bring blockchain scaling alongside simplicity and safety for builders. This contrasts Solana, which offers scaling at the cost of complexity, and Ethereum, which provides a richer ecosystem at the tradeoffs of governance through a rigid technocracy and inferior technology. Tactically, Sui and Aptos offer a better user experience for crypto’s current use case – speculation and value transfer. Strategically, they lay the groundwork for future non-speculative applications like AI agents, social media, cloud services, and marketing. While the future blockbuster crypto applications are uncertain, Sui and Aptos stand out as strong contenders for attracting the blockchain users of&nbsp;tomorrow.\n\nBut what makes these systems exceptional, and which is better?\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Blockchain Performance and&nbsp;Scalability\n\nWhile Sui and Aptos both utilize the Move programming language, their blockchains are architected with distinct design philosophies. Each network employs its own version of Move, optimized for different tradeoffs that influence how transactions are&nbsp;processed.\n\nWhen a transaction is sent to a blockchain, it contains information that tells the blockchain’s software what parts of the blockchain’s database (called state) it wants to change. Blockchain engineers call these database updates “state changes.” Most blockchains operate in a hierarchy where one validator acts as the “leader” for a set period of time before a new one is selected. During a validator’s leadership span, it ingests incoming transactions, determines their validity (ensuring authorization, correct signatures, and no double-spending), orders them, executes the changes, and then updates the blockchain’s state. The resulting block of transactions (the block in the blockchain) is broadcast to the other validators in the network. These validators also verify, execute, and synchronize their copies of the state with other validators. Once a supermajority (66%) of validators agree that the state update is valid, the blockchain progresses to the next block of&nbsp;transactions.\n\nA blockchain's architecture can be segmented into two primary components:\n\nProcessing transactions and building blocks of transactions\n\nVerifying transaction authenticity\n\nEnsuring sufficient account balances\n\nExecuting smart contracts\n\nUpdating the blockchain’s ledger\n\nCommunicating block across the network\n\nBroadcasting the block of transactions across the network\n\nSynchronizing the changes made to the blockchain’s ledger so all validators hold the exact copy of the state\n\nHandling conflicts that arise during ledger reconciliation for all validators\n\nTo improve transaction throughput, blockchains must either increase the volume of data transmitted across the network (enabling larger transaction blocks) or optimize the efficiency of data processing and communication (enhancing the message exchange process). Sui and Aptos tackle these challenges differently by leveraging their unique adaptations of Move to push the boundaries of blockchain technology to increase the efficiency and volume of data each&nbsp;processes.\n\nBlockchain Transaction Throughput = Block Size x Block Processing&nbsp;Speed\n\nBoth Aptos and Sui optimize methods to increase the size of the data that can be processed and how quickly the network disseminates that data. This analysis examines their approaches to the first step, “Processing transactions and building blocks of transactions,” to highlight each chain's unique advantages and&nbsp;tradeoffs.\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 12/19/2024.\n\nTo simplify the technology behind Aptos and Sui, imagine blockchains as restaurants:\n\nThe blockchain is the restaurant\n\nIt provides the infrastructure and environment where the entire process takes place.\n\nThe blockchain users are the customers\n\nThey interact with the restaurant by placing orders, just as users interact with the blockchain through transactions.\n\nUser transactions are restaurant orders\n\nThese are specific requests made by customers that require processing and fulfillment.\n\nThe onchain applications are the waiters\n\nWaiters act as intermediaries, taking customer orders (transactions) and delivering them to the kitchen (validator) for processing. They also return the completed orders (state changes) to the customers.\n\nThe Leader Validator is the kitchen\n\nThe kitchen is responsible for processing orders (validating and executing transactions) and preparing the output (state changes).\n\nThe state change is the food delivered to the customer\n\nThe final product, representing the processed transaction or updated blockchain state, is served to the customer.\n\nIn this analogy, improvements in blockchain technology introduced by Aptos and Sui can be likened to optimizing the restaurant’s operations. This includes making the kitchen faster and the waiters more efficient and ensuring orders are processed and delivered to customers quickly and&nbsp;accurately.\n\nEthereum is a slow&nbsp;restaurant\n\nEthereum is software that processes one state update at a time, and this happens only after transactions are accumulated in a list over a relatively lengthy period. Each block of transactions is small and can handle only a limited number of operations. Additionally, transactions are processed sequentially rather than in parallel, meaning each one must be executed one after the other. Even if transactions touch different parts of the blockchain’s state, they must wait for other transactions to be processed. This combination of small block sizes, infrequent updates, and sequential execution leads to low throughput and creates significant scalability&nbsp;challenges.\n\nTo make things more clear, imagine Ethereum as a restaurant with many waiters taking orders from tables but only one cook in the kitchen. Meals are prepared by that chef, one at a time. At the Ethereum Restaurant, customers give their food orders to their waiters, and these waiters come together to build the orders into a giant list. The list size is very limited; if a customer does not buy an expensive enough item, his order is bumped off the list (and he still owes money for his order). Once a period of time passes, roughly 12 seconds, the list of customer orders is sent to the Chef, and he arranges the batch as he sees&nbsp;fit.\n\nAt the ‘Ethereum Restaurant,’ the Chef is very “entrepreneurial,” so he accepts “tips” to process orders first so that customers can receive their food sooner. Once the Chef has decided on the order sequence, he prepares the food according to the customer's preferred meal. This almost always means the Chef cooks food first for patrons who give the largest&nbsp;tips.\n\nSince the ‘Ethereum Restaurant’ has only one person making food, many tables placing orders at once will result in a long queue of orders. While many consider the food at the ‘Ethereum Restaurant’ to be very good, it has proven far too popular and cannot scale up to customer demand. Patrons of ‘Ethereum’s Restaurant’ are annoyed by the long wait times and the high costs of “tipping” the head waiter to get a timely meal. They particularly despise the experience of paying a lot of money and not receiving&nbsp;food.\n\nAt the ‘Ethereum Restaurant,’ Orders are Processed One at a Time (Even if They Don’t Conflict)\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 12/19/2024.\n\nSui and Aptos apply parallelization to make their restaurants&nbsp;faster\n\nBlockchains like Sui and Aptos have made a big improvement by allowing transactions to be parallelized. This is accomplished by allowing transactions that do not conflict to occur simultaneously. In practice, this means that transactions using different applications or simple payments can be processed together. Other blockchains, like Solana and Monad, can parallel processing, but Sui and Aptos currently offer the most advanced&nbsp;designs.\n\nIn the example of a restaurant, this capability of parallel processing would be equivalent to the restaurant adding many cooks to the kitchen. At the Sui/Aptos restaurants, the expanded staff can prepare many meals at once to fulfill customer orders much faster. However, how each blockchain achieves parallelization is very different and comes with tradeoffs. While there are now more chefs to process orders, each restaurant’s kitchen is still limited by the amount of equipment it&nbsp;possesses.\n\nIf six tables order pizza at the same time, limited space in the pizza oven means that some pizzas must be cooked before the others. On blockchain, this would be like two traders competing to get the best price on the same DEX on the same coin. These “conflicts” must be resolved, and Sui and Aptos have different methods of doing this. In fact, the pros and cons of each blockchain’s processing scheme have important implications for application developers and each’s ability to&nbsp;scale.\n\nAt ‘Casa Sui’ and ‘Le Maison de Aptos’, Orders That Do Not Conflict with Others and Can Be Processed Simultaneously to Increase&nbsp;Throughput\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 12/19/2024.\n\nFine dining at ‘Casa&nbsp;Sui’\n\nSui employs a method to parallelize orders called “static parallelism,” which is similar to Solana’s process. This means that transactions on Sui must explicitly specify the parts of the blockchain’s ledger they want to read and write. Because Sui then knows what parts of the blockchain a transaction wants to touch, it can then allow other transactions that touch different parts to be processed at the same time. In the case where two transactions try to write to the same part of the blockchain simultaneously, Sui recognizes the conflict before the transactions are processed. To resolve the conflict, Sui determines which transaction comes first based on ordering criteria like fees paid, when the transaction was received,&nbsp;etc.\n\nReturning to the restaurant example, we can better understand what this looks like in practice. At the Sui restaurant “Casa Sui,” when a table orders, the waiter takes the order and mentally breaks down the order to determine which parts of the kitchen will be used during preparation. If a hamburger and french fries are ordered, the waiter tells the kitchen to use the grill and the fryer. In turn, one of Sui’s many chefs “locks” the area of the kitchen he needs to prepare the meal. During this “lock,” no other orders can be processed using that same kitchen equipment. However, items that use other parts of the kitchen can be cooked at the same&nbsp;time.\n\nIf two waiters simultaneously try to call on the same parts of the kitchen, ‘Casa Sui’s’ ordering system recognizes the “conflict” before the cooking begins. In that conflict scenario, one order is selected to be cooked first and the other to come&nbsp;afterward.\n\nLet’s assume three orders are placed simultaneously:\n\nTable A orders white pizza\n\nTable B orders black pizza (the house specialty at ‘Casa Sui’)\n\nTable C orders salmon\n\nIn the case above, Table A’s and Table B’s orders conflict because they both use the pizza oven. However, Sui’s waiters both determine this dependency upfront and determine the best ordering. So, ‘Casa Sui’ selects Table B’s order to go first and Table A’s to go after. Meanwhile, the salmon is processed without any hold-up because it was known in advance that the grill station would be&nbsp;free.\n\nAt ‘Casa Sui,’ Waiters Call Out the Kitchen Equipment to be Used, and Ordering is Finalized&nbsp;After\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 12/19/2024.\n\nHaute Cuisine by ‘Le Maison De&nbsp;Aptos’\n\nAt ‘Le Maison de Aptos’, the setup is very similar. There are ample waiters taking orders and many chefs cooking, but a limited supply of culinary equipment. However, Aptos does not worry about kitchen conflicts occurring. Aptos makes that tradeoff by assuming that conflicts in the kitchen are rare and can be quickly resolved. As such, Aptos uses what is called “dynamic” parallelism, which is similar to what Monad employs. In this model, transactions do not specify what parts of the state they touch. Instead, orders are “optimistically” processed, assuming they do not&nbsp;conflict.\n\nOn Aptos, an algorithm called the “Scheduler” processes transactions based on maximizing the output of transactions over the shortest period of time. However, it only finds conflicting transactions when it actually goes to write the change in the blockchain’s state. In the event there is a conflict, the conflicting transactions and any dependent transactions are sent back to the scheduler, who must sift through the conflicts and resolve them. Thereafter, once the issues are settled, the set of transactions is processed to&nbsp;completion.\n\nOn Aptos, the waiters do not have to assess which parts of the kitchen must be touched. Instead, they simply pass the orders to the kitchen. Once the orders reach the kitchen, the “Kitchen Head” (The Scheduler) receives them and determines the most efficient cooking process. When orders come in, the Kitchen Head assumes there are no conflicts and orders the cooks to begin cooking food. If there is a conflict, it is only discovered once the cooks start cooking. In the event of a dispute, the cooks must stop cooking, throw away the partially completed meal, and ask the Kitchen Head to resolve the dispute. After scheduling the meal components, the orders are processed. While the process of “throwing away the whole meal” sounds like a waste and would slow down ‘Le Maison de Aptos’, under most circumstances, it does not impact the output very much. This is because Aptos’s kitchen is very, very&nbsp;fast.\n\nAt ‘Le Maison de Aptos’, the Scheduler Tries to Cook All Items Immediately. If a Conflict Occurs, the Chef Sends Back the Conflicting Requests to be&nbsp;Ordered\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 12/23/2024.\n\nBut what are the implications of each model?\n\nAptos is more manageable for&nbsp;developers\n\nAptos is considered by many to be a more flexible system because it does not force transactions to specify the parts of the state they touch upfront. This is important for developers because when they build applications, they must work through all the necessary dependencies and write the code to describe them. In the example of the restaurant, where the developers are waiters, processing customer orders on Aptos is much easier than it is on Sui because the waiters do not have to think about what parts of the kitchen are used for an order. From the standpoint of attracting builders to an ecosystem, some consider this development annoyance to be frustrating enough to opt for Aptos over Sui. This is because writing out extra code takes time, and dependencies may need to be changed often. As a result of Aptos design, development is more straightforward for its application&nbsp;creators.\n\nAdditionally, many dependencies are difficult to know upfront for both users and developers. While developers want optionality in application design, users may want many different transaction pathways that they will not know in advance. Due to the preference for optionality of both developers and users, in a system like Sui, transactions may “lock” part of the state that they do not need, which causes other transactions to be held&nbsp;up.\n\nIf a business relies upon lots of shared resources to operate, it will be challenging for it to reserve all resources at once using Sui’s format. In some cases, a business on Sui may even lock parts of the blockchain it does not need, preventing others from using those areas. In the example of the restaurant at ‘Maison de Aptos’, a patron can tell the waiter he desires “chicken” and that he wants whichever type is made fastest (open kitchen spot) between fried, baked, or grilled. Meanwhile, at Casa Sui, the customer must tell the waiter which kind of chicken he wants upfront, and the customer cannot embed&nbsp;contingencies.\n\nSui is more&nbsp;efficient\n\nSui resolves conflicts between competing transactions upfront, allowing it to establish an order at the outset. This approach reduces the need for computational resources to handle conflicts during execution, freeing up the capacity to process additional transactions. This design is advantageous in scenarios with heavy decentralized exchange (DEX) activity, often called “contentious state writes,” such as traders competing for arbitrage&nbsp;opportunities.\n\nAptos, by contrast, detects and resolves conflicts dynamically during transaction processing. Under normal conditions, the difference in performance between the two chains is minimal, as Aptos's conflict resolution takes only a few milliseconds. This is because Aptos transactions being processed into a block reside “in memory,” the processor's cache, enabling very fast processing. However, the Aptos transaction scheduler can become a bottleneck during extreme trading scenarios. High levels of contention require repeated detection, rollback, reordering, and re-execution of conflicting transactions, which can significantly slow down transaction&nbsp;processing.\n\nKingman’s Formula from operations management illustrates that as system utilization approaches its maximum capacity, small increases in load, like conflicting transactions per second, will result in exponentially longer wait times. For Aptos, heavy trading activity can overwhelm its scheduler and significantly degrade performance. While such scenarios have not yet occurred on Aptos, they remain a potential risk, particularly during events with significant trading&nbsp;contention.\n\nNotably, blockchain transaction throughput (TPS) benchmarks often focus on simple wallet transfers rather than real-world trading scenarios. This discrepancy means chains boasting high TPS may struggle under contentious trading conditions, where conflict resolution is&nbsp;critical.\n\nRestaurant Analogy: Sui is like a restaurant kitchen that pre-sorts orders to prevent clashes over limited kitchen space. Even during busy periods, kitchen space at ‘Casa Sui’ is more efficiently allocated. Aptos, however, resolves conflicts dynamically, which usually works well but can create chaos during peak times. Imagine a Friday night at ‘Maison de Aptos,’ with multiple diners competing for the popular Dover sole. The kitchen staff must re-check, re-cook, and re-serve orders amid the rush, resembling Lucy and Ethel struggling to keep up at the chocolate factory. This can lead to delays and inefficiencies under high demand, highlighting the potential drawbacks of Aptos's dynamic&nbsp;scheduler.\n\nA Blockchain Burdened by Too Many DEX Transactions (Colorized)\n\nSource: I Love Lucy as of 12/17/2024.\n\nOf course, Sui has its own bottlenecks and challenges due to the use of \"write-locks.\" Transactions in Sui can reserve sections of the blockchain during processing, but some may fail to utilize the reserved resources effectively. This inefficiency can lead to certain parts of the blockchain being \"boxed out,\" preventing other transactions from accessing them until the write-lock is released. Such scenarios could reduce overall system efficiency, especially under heavy transaction loads or when write-lock contention is&nbsp;high.\n\nSui enables “Local Fee&nbsp;Markets”\n\nSui’s approach to resolving state writes upfront introduces a unique advantage called “local fee markets.” This feature allows Sui to manage transaction costs more efficiently by segmenting fees based on the specific parts of its blockchain being accessed. In practice, this means that the cost of interacting with a heavily used application on Sui can increase without affecting fees for other&nbsp;applications.\n\nFor example, if there is high demand for trading in the SUI/USDC pool on the Sui-based DEX Aftermath Finance, the blockchain can raise transaction fees specifically for that pool. However, users accessing other applications or parts of the blockchain will not face increased fees. This localized pricing model contrasts with blockchains like Aptos and Ethereum, which operate global fee markets. On these platforms, a surge in demand for one application, such as during a popular NFT minting event, raises transaction fees for all users. This makes the entire blockchain more expensive and difficult to&nbsp;use.\n\nRestaurant Analogy: At the ‘Casa Sui’, cooking stations can each set prices for usage relative to demand. For instance, if there’s a rush for sea urchin ravioli, the pasta station can raise its prices, but the cost of triple-stuffed steak quesadillas from the grill station remains unaffected. Conversely, all kitchen resources share a single pricing mechanism at ‘Maison de Aptos’. If demand for ceviche ice cream spikes, the fees for unrelated items like red snapper pizza will also rise, even if the pizza oven is&nbsp;underutilized.\n\nSui unlocks Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)\n\nSui’s design also enables service-level agreements (SLAs) on its blockchain. Validators on Sui can make binding commitments to applications regarding transaction latency and pricing on a per-day basis. This guarantees specific performance levels, ensuring businesses building on Sui do not have to worry about being crowded out by high activity elsewhere on the blockchain. For example, a business running an e-commerce platform on Sui can lock in agreements for low transaction fees and quick processing times. Sui's architecture ensures that operations remain unaffected even during high demand on unrelated applications, such as DEX&nbsp;trading.\n\nThis capability gives businesses a level of predictability and reliability that is unavailable on most other blockchains. For developers and enterprises, this creates a compelling reason to choose Sui as a platform, as it allows them to focus on growth and operations without worrying about network congestion or fluctuating&nbsp;fees.\n\nSui’s blockchain is faster while enabling new&nbsp;scaling\n\nTime to Finality Favors&nbsp;Sui\n\nSource: Circle, Project Docs as of 12/19/2024. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities&nbsp;namedherein.\n\nFor simple transactions like payments, Sui has two mechanisms that surpass other blockchains in terms of latency (user feedback time) and throughput (TPS). Sui calls these “Fast Path” and “Pilot Fish.” Fast Path allows simple payment transactions to bypass consensus, resulting in transaction latencies as low as 300ms. Meanwhile, Pilot Fish demonstrates that Sui can be scaled nearly infinitely by allowing validators to add additional servers to process more transactions&nbsp;seamlessly.\n\nSui’s unique scaling capabilities stem from the interaction between its transaction processing model, its version of the Move smart contract language, and its consensus mechanism. A key distinction of Sui is its state architecture, which is composed of flexible, modular units called objects. This differs from the more rigid account-based structure found on blockchains like&nbsp;Ethereum.\n\nOn Ethereum, accounts do not directly \"hold\" a balance of USDC. Instead, balances are tracked within the Ethereum-based USDC smart contract, which acts as a ledger for all USDC owners. When a user sends USDC to someone else, they must interact with the USDC smart contract. This process involves calling the contract to deduct the sender’s balance and credit the recipient’s balance. Every USDC transfer requires an interaction with the smart contract, which can introduce&nbsp;inefficiencies.\n\nWhen Patrick sends Greg USDC on Sui, it deletes the $1,000 object to create two new $500 objects; one is sent to&nbsp;Greg.\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 12/23/2024.\n\nIn contrast, Sui uses a more fluid object-based model. Balances of USDC on Sui are not centralized as ledger entries within a single contract. Instead, USDC exists as an object that individual user accounts own directly. Each USDC object is defined by:\n\nOwnership: The account controlling the object\n\nType: The token type (ex: USDC)\n\nMetadata: Additional details such as the amount of USDC\n\nWhen users transfer USDC on Sui, they transfer ownership of the USDC object itself. For example, if I send USDC to another account, I create a new USDC object representing the transferred balance, and ownership of that object is assigned to the recipient’s account. This eliminates the need to repeatedly call a central contract for every transaction, significantly improving&nbsp;efficiency.\n\nBy allowing accounts to own and manage token objects directly, Sui achieves a more decentralized and scalable design. This object-based approach reduces bottlenecks caused by interactions with centralized smart contracts and provides a flexible framework for state management. This design significantly impacts blockchain parallelization. For example, suppose two entities send USDC simultaneously on Solana or Aptos. Their transactions must be ordered in that case because both will interact with the USDC smart contract and touch the same part of the Solana/Aptos state. In contrast, Sui’s accounts own USDC as individual objects. When two entities send USDC, the transactions only modify the ownership of their respective token objects. As a result, these transactions can be processed in parallel, enabling higher throughput and efficiency. However, transactions involving the same object must still be serialized to maintain&nbsp;consistency.\n\nSui Latencies\nExclusively owned by one account\nAccessible and modifiable by multiple accounts\n\nConsensus Requirement\nNo (local validators can process)\nYes (all validators must agree)\n\nExecution Path\nSingle validator validates, executes, and signs\nValidators execute after consensus\n\nRound Trip Times (RTT)\n2xRTT @ 150ms per RTT\n4xRTT @ 200ms per RTT\n\nLatency\n~300ms\n~800ms\n\nConflict Potential\nNone (exclusive ownership guarantees safety)\nPotential conflicts require resolution\n\nSource: VanEck Research as of 12/17/2024.\n\nSui introduces a unique property where simple object transfers, such as payments, do not require consensus. This is possible because these object transfers can only be initiated by the owner and do not need to be globally ordered. All that is required is a signature verification and an update to the state by the validators to reflect the transfer. By contrast, in Ethereum, Solana, and Aptos, calling a smart contract (like the USDC contract) must go through consensus, as transactions must be globally&nbsp;ordered.\n\nConsensus is one of the most time-consuming aspects of blockchain transaction processing, often accounting for 70% or more of the total processing time in high-throughput blockchains like Solana. This is because validators worldwide must exchange messages to agree on the transaction order. The time taken is measured in \"RTTs\" (round trips of messaging), where each RTT can take 150ms–250ms, depending on the validators' geographic locations. By bypassing consensus for simple transfers, Sui eliminates this delay, shaving up to 500ms off transaction processing&nbsp;time.\n\nRestaurant Analogy: This would be similar to ‘Casa Sui,’ offering diners the option of a pre-cooked meal. This significantly reduces service time and expands the number of diners who can be served. In contrast, at other blockchain \"restaurants,\" all orders must go through the kitchen, regardless of&nbsp;complexity.\n\nSui’s unique pathway to “infinite” TPS: Pilot&nbsp;Fish\n\nSui’s object-based structure enables near-unlimited scaling through a mechanism called Pilot Fish. Most blockchains scale by optimizing software to run efficiently within the constraints of a single server per validator. Sui’s design, however, allows validators to scale horizontally by using multiple servers. This means a validator facing resource constraints (e.g., memory, bandwidth, or computational power) can add servers to handle more&nbsp;transactions.\n\nWhile \"hot\" (high demand) areas of the blockchain still require ordered transaction processing, the ability to distribute processing across multiple servers prevents bottlenecks in other parts of the&nbsp;blockchain.\n\nRestaurant Analogy: If ‘Casa Sui's’ main kitchen becomes overwhelmed, additional kitchens with specialized equipment can be contracted to handle the load. While patrons ordering popular dishes may face wait times, others can enjoy meals prepared in less busy&nbsp;stations.\n\nAptos’s response: Quorum&nbsp;Store\n\nAptos has developed a scaling mechanism called Quorum Store that optimizes blockchain speed by focusing on the consensus process (the second part of blockchain processing) to increase throughput and reduce latency. It allows more validators to participate in the initial transaction processing than just the leader. Traditionally, blockchains rely on a leader-validator system, where one validator at a time ingests transactions, creates blocks, and updates the blockchain’s state. Leadership rotates periodically, usually based on the amount of stake&nbsp;held.\n\nQuorum Store disrupts this model by allowing any validator to disseminate transactions across the network, not just the leader. This frees up the leader to focus on proposing the blocks and disseminating those blocks. This speeds up the time needed to process transactions and enables other validators to do some of the leader’s&nbsp;workload.\n\nHowever, Quorum Store may exacerbate Aptos's scheduler challenges under high-conflict scenarios, such as when many transactions compete for the same trade. In these cases, multiple validators proposing conflicting blocks can slow Aptos’s ability to resolve dependencies and conflicts. Nevertheless, in most scenarios, Quorum Store improves transaction&nbsp;efficiency.\n\nAptos is more robust than&nbsp;Sui\n\nIn blockchain design, as in life, “there is no such thing as a free lunch,” and Sui’s design introduces new problems alongside its unique capabilities. One key decision is to skip a process called DAG certification, which serves as an additional check on transaction authenticity. This decision reduces the number of RTTs (round trips of messaging) required during consensus, resulting in faster transaction&nbsp;processing.\n\nHowever, bypassing DAG certification comes with trade-offs. By skipping this step, Sui’s network may not be as robust as Aptos’s under certain conditions. For instance, packet loss, a common phenomenon in internet communication, can impact Sui more severely than other blockchains. Some researchers claim that a minor packet drop, such as a 1% loss affecting 5 of Sui’s 100 validators, could significantly degrade the network’s performance. While these claims should be interpreted cautiously due to a lack of transparent methodology, they highlight a potential vulnerability in Sui’s design. Under specific scenarios, Sui could experience transaction latency issues that more robust designs like Aptos might&nbsp;avoid.\n\nAnother consideration is the potential for malicious behavior by validators. Without DAG certification, Sui’s network may allow validators to exploit vulnerabilities. For example, malicious validators could disrupt network operations more easily than Aptos, which has stronger safeguards through its consensus processes. While substantial attacks on proof-of-stake (PoS) systems remain rare, and these vulnerabilities are still largely theoretical, Sui’s broader attack surface could pose a greater risk as the ecosystem&nbsp;matures.\n\nSui has more traction, but this lead could be&nbsp;fleeting\n\nBoth Move blockchains are less than a few years old; their usership is in its early innings. Despite immense potential, Sui and Aptos’s ecosystems are relatively small. Sui is currently leading Aptos based on the most fundamental metrics of usership. Though Sui and Aptos have roughly the same number of monthly active addresses, 8.6M for Sui and 11.5M for Aptos, Sui excels in economic statistics. Note: Active Addresses may not be a reliable measure of user activity due to the simplicity of one user controlling multiples addresses. From the standpoint of fee revenues, Sui has captured 6x of the fee revenue of Aptos in the past year ($10.4M vs $1.7M). Sui has also transacted 3.5x the DEX volume of Aptos ($38.3B vs $10.8B). When looking at DeFi TVL, Sui has $1.6B vs Aptos with $930M. However, Aptos ($750M) has more stablecoins on the chain than Sui ($476M).\n\nTotal Spot Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Volumes, Last 100-Days ($M)\n\nSource: Artemis XYZ as of 1/21/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities&nbsp;namedherein.\n\nDrilling down further into each ecosystem’s constituents, both have most of the core components needed to facilitate speculation-focused use cases of crypto. Each ecosystem has ample applications in DEX, Borrow/Lend, and Perp Futures categories. Early as we are, Sui has stronger entities within the Borrow/Lend category in Suilend and Navi, each boasting over $450M in TVL. By comparison, the largest app on Aptos holds $300M. Sui has a deeper perpetual futures trading market, mostly centered around an application called BlueFin. Bluefin averages around $250M in trading volume and ranks 7th in all crypto. However, Aptos has a more successful decentralized stablecoin project, called Thala ($135M TVL), than Sui’s, called Bucket Protocol ($73M TVL).\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Ecosystems Have Grown Remarkably But Are Still&nbsp;Nascent\n\nThe go-to market for attracting developers for Sui and Aptos has been to offer substantial incentives for builders to come to each chain. For example, on October 13, 2023, Sui pledged 157M SUI tokens to incentivize the growth of its ecosystem. In practical terms, this has been utilized to bootstrap its DeFI by rewarding those who trade, borrow, and lend. We estimate that the collective impact of Sui’s incentives resulted in rewards that have added 5.2%-10% in annualized yields since June 2024. We estimate that Sui has awarded more than 70M Sui in incentives in 2024 alone, worth ~$300M&nbsp;today.\n\nFollowing a similar pathway to attracting DeFI TVL and usership as Sui, Aptos currently adds ~6.5% in APT rewards to borrow/lend deposited USDC/USDT while adding 8%-12% to deposited BTC. It also adds ~15%-20% APT rewards to DEX pools to encourage liquidity. We estimate that Aptos spent over 10M APT worth around $100M to incentivize its DeFI ecosystem. While Sui has spent more than Aptos in dollar terms, we estimate Aptos has allocated slightly more of its token supply than Sui (0.9% vs. 0.7%).\n\nThe result has been that both Sui and Aptos bootstrapped very important components of each ecosystem very quickly. However, this has also led to substantial “mercenary capital” (users only there to extract rewards) deploying to each chain. Similar to a federal government providing subsidies for an industry, the Sui and Aptos incentive campaigns have created a massive ecosystem. Still, it is yet to be seen if it is&nbsp;sustainable.\n\nSui community is further along than&nbsp;Aptos’s\n\nSui and Aptos have focused on creating their respective communities by asserting each chain’s technical supremacy. Though many developers herald the advantage of the Move programming language and some have fallen into the camps of Sui or Aptos, there is currently no material depth to either chain’s culture compared to legacy blockchains. We assert this based upon Google search interest in each’s memecoins and the total number of developers tracked in public repositories. While Sui averaged 280 weekly active developers in 1H2024, Aptos recorded 272. These figures compare to Ethereum, which had 3,300, and Solana, which had 1,200. Together, Sui and Aptos builders represent less than 4% of all active developers in crypto. From the standpoint of retail interest in each’s community, Sui is ahead of Aptos by a factor of nearly 9x when examining Google Trends (Aptos: 2 vs. Sui: 9). In fact, in the last 90 days, global search interest for Sui was higher than it was for Solana on 17 days and higher than Ethereum on 16&nbsp;days.\n\nThe consequence of the relatively anemic development community of Aptos and Sui is that neither can boast of a truly differentiated, successful application. Though Sui has a few interesting applications like “FanTV” and “Birds,” neither application has attracted significant usage. Another current disappointment of Sui and Aptos is that neither has an application leveraging the unique technical capabilities of either chain. For example, the most important perpetual exchange on Sui, called Bluefin, has its entire trading engine deployed on Bluefin’s private server and not on Sui’s&nbsp;blockchain.\n\nSui Outpaces Aptos in Google Searches Over the Last 90&nbsp;Days\n\nSource: Google Trends as of 1/21/2025.\n\nSui’s Top Decentralized Apps (dApps) are DeFi and&nbsp;Infrastructure\n\nSource: Artemis XYZ as of 1/21/2025.\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Trading&nbsp;Experience\n\nSui’s system is currently better for traders than&nbsp;Aptos\n\nSui has created a better system for traders, which should translate into better prices for Sui DEXes. We base this upon the following components:\n\nProgrammable Transaction Blocks (PTB)\n\nPredictable Gas Pricing\n\nAdvantageous Fee Structure for Large Transactions\n\nLocal Fee Markets\n\nDeepBook\n\nSui has poured tremendous thought into building a system optimized for onchain trading through built-in components of Sui’s code and innovations created by Sui’s team. The first is the concept of programmable transaction blocks (PTB), which enable a single transaction to dynamically interact with multiple parts of the blockchain state, executing up to 1024 commands. Unlike other blockchains, such as Ethereum or Aptos, where transactions call a pre-defined function, Sui’s PTBs allow transactions to dynamically decide which calls to make and which parts of the state to touch. This dynamism enables real-time decision-making based on both onchain and offchain data, providing unprecedented&nbsp;flexibility.\n\nThis capability is particularly significant for applications requiring high performance, such as decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators. On Sui, these aggregators can leverage offchain compute (like ASICS/GPUs) to determine optimal trading routes, incorporating both onchain liquidity and external pricing data. Due to their rigid transaction structures, this level of sophistication is challenging or impossible on Ethereum or Aptos. Furthermore, Sui’s design surpasses Solana in practical applications. While Solana theoretically allows similar functionality, its stringent limits on the number of input accounts (64) and maximum transaction instructions significantly restrict its usability. For example, a complex Sui transaction that interacts with more than 100 objects would be unfeasible on Solana. This makes Sui a more robust platform for advanced trading&nbsp;applications.\n\nBoth Sui and Aptos set their transaction prices based on the complexity of a transaction measured in network resources used (gas). Gas is the cost, in native tokens, that each network charges for some unit of resource utilization. Aptos gas prices function by having governance set a minimum gas price at an indeterminate interval and then allowing gas prices to float above this minimum based on transaction demand. Aptos does not have a priority tip separate from the gas price; instead, priority is achieved by setting the gas (cost per unit of network resource used) higher. Sui’s validators set a “reference price” that bonds validators to process all transactions that pay this reference price. To gain a higher spot in the processing queue, a transactor on Sui can attach a priority fee to their transaction. As explained previously, Aptos has a global gas price that does not charge larger fees for higher-demand pieces of Aptos blockchain (like a DEX with lots of trading). In comparison, Sui enables more in-demand parts of the state to charge higher fees than lower-priority parts of the&nbsp;state.\n\nThese seemingly minuscule differences are important because they affect the economics of traders in meaningful ways. Particularly important traders called “market makers” often place and cancel (updating) thousands (or more) of orders per second. This is done to bid/offer advantageous prices relative to newly developing information. With PTBs that change many parts of the state simultaneously, a market maker can update their book of bids/asks with fewer transactions. This alone makes operating on Sui cheaper than other chains like&nbsp;Aptos.\n\nFinally, Sui has an interesting component of architecture embedded in its blockchain called “DeepBook,” which is a global centralized limit order book (CLOB) on Sui for wholesale liquidity. This liquidity layer allows DEXes and DEX aggregators (entities that access all DEXes in their selection set) to tap into global liquidity across Sui. This centralized order book aggregates liquidity across Sui into one unified pool and enables deeper liquidity for traders operating on Sui. Since any app can tap into their liquidity layer, it reduces the advantages of applications with lots of liquidity thus leveling the playing field and lowering the prices that DEXes can charge&nbsp;users.\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Similar&nbsp;Tokenomics\n\nSui Earned 24% More Revenue in November Than Aptos Has in the Past&nbsp;Year\n\nSource: Artemis XYZ as of 1/15/2025.\n\nSui and Aptos have both designed their systems so that high usage of each respective blockchain will accrue value to each respective token. If either gets many users, its token’s value will likely appreciate in price. In fact, both blockchains’ chief token use cases are very similar:\n\nPayment for Gas Fees\n\nDeposit for Storage Fees\n\nValidator Staking\n\nNetwork Governance\n\nOne key difference between SUI vs. APT tokens is that SUI has a capped supply of tokens while APT tokens have no maximum supply. Aptos inflation currently rests at 6.7% per annum and decreases each year by 1.5%. However, this endless supply of APT due to persistent inflation is offset by the fact that transaction fees on Aptos result in a token burn. Sui, by contrast, does not burn fees on its transactions. The consequence is that more activity on Sui will benefit those staking tokens over those not staking tokens. This is because those who stake validators on Sui will receive the transaction fees. On Aptos, since the token is burned, an increase in transaction fees benefits everyone equally. However, it must be noted that while Aptos can achieve a deflationary token system through substantial activity, Sui has it baked in by means of its storage system. More&nbsp;below.\n\nAn interesting feature of Sui and Aptos is their approach to addressing the long-term challenges associated with storing crypto data onchain. Blockchains continuously grow in storage size, measured in gigabytes and terabytes, which must be maintained by validators and nodes. This poses a problem because the increasing storage demands drive up costs and place additional strain on blockchain networks. Ideally, blockchains would charge for data storage, but most do not. Instead, they primarily charge transaction fees based on the consumption of network resources like bandwidth, compute power, and RAM. However, these costs are transient as they account only for the resources consumed at the moment of the&nbsp;transaction.\n\nMost blockchains fail to charge fees for persistent resources, such as the ongoing cost of storing a user's account data and transaction history on the blockchain. Sui and Aptos address this issue by incorporating the cost of data creation into transaction fees. In other words, they price new data storage directly within the transaction, ensuring that users contribute to the long-term costs of maintaining the blockchain's&nbsp;storage.\n\nOn Aptos, storage fees in APT are locked behind the data that is created. If someone modifies the data to be smaller or deletes the data entirely, a portion or all of that locked APT is remitted to whoever deleted that data. On Sui, the process of removing data from Sui’s storage also allows for a refund of stored SUI. However, while most of the SUI can be returned (up to 99%), the rest remains in the fund, creating a permanent “token sink” of SUI. This storage fund earns rewards from the network (newly minted SUI allocated from the original 10B total supply). This fund then remits SUI rewards to the Sui network validators to help them pay the long-term costs of storing SUI’s blockchain&nbsp;ledger.\n\nBoth Sui and Aptos face significant amounts of token unlocks that will occur in the next few years. The current floating supply of Aptos is greater than that of Sui (39.9% vs. 30.9%). Over the next year, both protocols will add significant amounts to the token supply as investor unlocks occur. While Aptos will have 11.9% of its total supply ($1.2B at current prices) unlock over the next year, Sui will emit 7.6% of its total supply ($3.65B at current prices).\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Our&nbsp;Valuation\n\nWe base our valuation of Sui and Aptos on their projected year-end market share within the total smart contract platform (SCP) market capitalization. Our forecast for SCP market capitalization is derived from the estimated growth of the United States M2 money supply, reflecting their historical correlation. We project M2 to reach approximately $22.3 trillion by the end of 2025, continuing its annualized growth rate of 3.2% since its last trough in October 2023.\n\nUsing regression analysis, we estimate the total SCP market value to reach $1.1 trillion by the end of 2025, a 43% increase from today’s capitalization of $770 billion. This compares to an all-time peak valuation for SCPs of $989 billion in November 2021. Historical analysis of M2 changes versus SCP market cap changes shows a strong statistical relationship. The 12-month moving average of SCP market cap changes correlated positively with monthly M2 changes, exhibiting an R² value of 0.36 and a t-statistic of 5.7 (p &lt; 0.0001).\n\nMarket Capitalization of Smart Contract Platforms (SCPs) Peaked in November 2024\n\nSource: Artemis XYZ as of 1/05/2024.\n\nCurrently, Move-based blockchains hold a combined market share of approximately 2.7% of the SCP market, split between Aptos (0.7%) and Sui (2%). We forecast this share to rise to 6.5%, using an AR model demonstrating the lowest AIC among comparable forecasting models. This model also predicts the individual shares for Aptos and&nbsp;Sui.\n\nSui and Aptos: Price Prediction Estimate by the End of 2025\n\nSui (SUI): 5.5% of the SCP market, corresponding to a market capitalization of $61 billion. With 3 billion tokens unlocked by January 2025, this equates to a token price of ~$16. This represents a 326% gain from today’s price of&nbsp;$3.75.\n\nAptos (APT): 1% of the SCP market, corresponding to a market capitalization of $11 billion. With 50.5% of its token supply (507 million tokens) unlocked, this equates to a token price of ~$22 and is a 201% gain from today’s price of $7.30.\n\nThese projections highlight the strong growth potential for both chains. We believe Sui and Aptos are poised to capture a larger share of the expanding SCP market as other chains lose their relative&nbsp;status.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The information, valuation scenarios, and price targets in this blog are not intended as financial advice or any call to action, a recommendation to buy or sell, or as a projection of how Sui (SUI) and Aptos (APT) will perform in the future. Actual future performance of Sui (SUI) and Aptos (APT) is unknown, and may differ significantly from the hypothetical results depicted here. There may be risks or other factors not accounted for in the scenarios presented that may impede the performance. These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your&nbsp;ownconclusions.\n\nSui vs. Aptos: Our&nbsp;Conclusion\n\nWe believe the evidence supports Sui over Aptos due to its performance advantages and scaling potential. We find that It currently offers capabilities that are not replicated in Aptos. Among these are Local Fee Markets, Pilot Fish, and Fast Path. Additionally, Sui may offer a set of technical capabilities and economics that prove more attractive to market markers, resulting in a better-priced DeFi ecosystem. From a marketing standpoint, Sui has formed its technical capabilities into powerful memetic narratives that have attracted token investors and application builders. This has translated into better token performance and a more vibrant ecosystem of&nbsp;applications.\n\nHowever, we believe that Aptos’s edge in designed flexibility and arguably more robust chain architecture may prove to be competitive advantages. While Sui has a substantial lead in many economic metrics, including TVL, DEX volumes, and transaction fees, this dynamic can quickly&nbsp;shift.\n\nThe long-term winner will depend on which platform can sustain innovation while translating it into ecosystem expansion, including novel applications of crypto&nbsp;technology.\n\nSui and Aptos Investment&nbsp;Risks\n\nBusiness Development\nThe greatest challenge facing both Aptos and Sui is achieving effective business development. While both projects have invested significant resources to incentivize ecosystem growth and emphasize their technical advantages, neither has yet developed a cohesive strategy that integrates technical development with ecosystem&nbsp;expansion.\n\nBoth blockchains represent state-of-the-art distributed systems design driven by teams at the forefront of technological innovation. However, business success requires more than technological breakthroughs. For token prices to thrive, Aptos and Sui must attract and cultivate differentiated projects while using feedback to inform technical&nbsp;direction.\n\nBuilding the best system is admirable, but it is crucial to strike a balance between advancements that address current usability challenges and those designed to enable future use cases. While both chains have successfully onboarding projects, their ecosystems must attract applications that leverage their unique capabilities to create innovative use cases. A unified approach, where business development collaborates closely with technical development, is essential to build technology that solves problems users care about. Without this alignment and differentiation, these systems risk failing to achieve their&nbsp;potential.\n\nTechnology\nSui and Aptos feature novel blockchain designs that have yet to be fully stress-tested in high-demand or adversarial environments. Although both have experienced surges in transaction volume, most were simple transactions rather than Solana-esque levels of DEX trading activity. This leaves uncertainty about how the systems would handle the intense trading conditions that have previously stressed many&nbsp;chains.\n\nAdditionally, while the innovative features of these blockchains (Pilot Fish, Quorum Store, Fast Path) are engineering marvels, they might require adjustments if significant performance issues arise under extreme scenarios. These changes could potentially compromise some of their high-level capabilities, making it critical for the teams to continuously refine their systems without losing their&nbsp;edge.\n\nCompetition\nAs second-generation high throughput blockchains, Aptos and Sui face competition from established ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana. While these older chains may lack the technical sophistication of Aptos and Sui, they benefit from larger developer bases and broader distribution backed by users with substantial financial&nbsp;resources.\n\nEmerging competitors like Monad and Berachain further intensify the landscape. Monad combines strong technology with a dedicated community, while Berachain has gained momentum by tapping into the crypto community's speculative animal spirits. Additionally, Solana's upcoming Firedancer upgrade, expected in 2025, promises to boost its performance, potentially surpassing Aptos and Sui in speed and&nbsp;throughput.\n\nThe trend seen with Aptos and Sui, investors backing the narrative of better technology, is not new but inherently fleeting. Blockchain teams must consistently deliver and implement new innovations quickly to maintain relevance. History is filled with high-performance blockchains that lost their edge and token valuations to newer, more advanced competitors. Given the enormous economic incentives in the blockchain space, many of the world’s brightest minds may pursue degrees in distributed systems engineering. These developing entrants will continue to the cadence of technological advancement, ensuring the competitive landscape remains&nbsp;dynamic.\n\nMacroeconomics\nLike all financial instruments, blockchain tokens are subject to broader economic cycles. As alternative forms of money and financial systems, they compete with traditional monetary frameworks. While political and economic reform seems unlikely in most nations, unexpected shifts in fiscal policy or financial prudence could impact crypto&nbsp;markets.\n\nCrypto markets also exhibit high sensitivity to financial policy cycles. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the supply of M2 and the value of smart contract platforms, reinforcing the importance of macroeconomic trends in shaping blockchain token&nbsp;valuations.\n\nRegulatory\nThe recent rise in crypto prices reflects optimism about regulatory clarity under the new Trump administration. Although the administration’s stance on crypto appears favorable, opposition to the industry remains strong and well-funded. While the executive branch’s administrative \"deep state\" (SEC, FDIC, CFTC, etc) may no longer actively undermine crypto, challenges will&nbsp;materialize.\n\nOne concern is the FIT 21 bill, which introduces criteria for determining whether a cryptocurrency qualifies as a commodity rather than a security. While this framework provides much-needed clarity, there is a risk that existing crypto incumbents and their allies may influence the bill’s language to impose stringent decentralization requirements. Such requirements could disqualify chains like Solana, Sui, and Aptos, making their tokens marketable only to qualified investors and limiting broader&nbsp;adoption.\n\nTo receive more Digital Assets insights, sign up in our subscription&nbsp;center.\n\nDIGITAL ASSETS UPDATES\n\nKeep up with the latest developments in the quickly moving crypto markets.\n\nEmail\n\nSIGN ME UP\n\nBY SUBMITTING YOUR EMAIL YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THE ONLINE Privacy Policy.\n\nScroll\n\nDISCLOSURES\n\nCoin&nbsp;Definitions\n\nEthereum (ETH): A decentralized, open-source blockchain platform with smart contract functionality, powered by its native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).\n\nSolana (SOL): A high-speed blockchain supporting decentralized applications, leveraging proof-of-stake and proof-of-history consensus mechanisms with its SOL token.\n\nCardano (ADA): A proof-of-stake blockchain platform focused on sustainability, scalability, and innovation, powered by its native token, ADA.\n\nSui (SUI): A high-throughput blockchain designed with object-based architecture, enabling scalability, low latency, and efficient state management.\n\nAptos (APT): A blockchain optimized for scalability and developer ease, leveraging dynamic parallelization and the Move programming language.\n\nDiem: A stablecoin payment system project originally developed by Facebook, later shelved due to regulatory challenges but inspired blockchain innovations.\n\nMove: A smart contract programming language developed by Diem, optimized for security and efficiency, and used by Sui and Aptos.\n\nUSDC (USD Coin): A fully backed, centralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, widely used in payments, trading, and DeFi applications.\n\nMonad: A high-throughput blockchain optimized for parallel transaction execution and scalability, aiming to balance performance and decentralization.\n\nBerachain: An emerging blockchain built on Cosmos, leveraging innovative staking mechanisms to integrate liquidity and governance for its ecosystem.\n\nRisk&nbsp;Considerations\n\nThis is not an offer to buy or sell, or a recommendation to buy or sell any of the securities, financial instruments or digital assets mentioned herein.

It aims to transform how decentralized applications (dApps) operate. Understanding Sui's tokenomics and functionality is essential whether you're looking to invest, stake, or actively participate in the ecosystem.\nIn this guide, we'll cover the fundamentals of the Sui network and what to expect from this blockchain in 2025.\n&nbsp;\nWhat is Sui?\nSui offers a fresh look at blockchain technology. It operates as a high-speed digital network where each asset exists as its object. The Sui coin is at the heart of the Sui Network, which fuels everything from governance to transaction processing and staking.\n\n&nbsp;\nCreated by former Meta engineers in May 2023, Sui processes transactions differently from traditional blockchains. Instead of processing one transaction at a time, it functions more like a multi-lane highway, allowing multiple transactions to move forward simultaneously.\nThis design, combined with the Move programming language, enables the platform to handle over 4.58 billion transactions across 18.19 million active accounts while maintaining speed and security.\n&nbsp;\nWho created Sui\nMysten Lab founders Evan Cheng, Adeniyi Abiodun, Sam Blackshear, George Danezis, and Kostas Chalkias are core members of the Sui team. They’re all former Meta engineers who worked in the Novi division.\nMysten Labs is backed by various investors, including Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), who invested $36 million in the company in December 2021 in a Series A round. This was followed by a $300 million Series B announcement, led by a $140 million commitment from FTX Ventures, valuing the startup at $2 billion.\nOther funds that have committed to Mysten Labs include Jump Crypto, Apollo, Binance Labs, Franklin Templeton, Coinbase Ventures, Circle Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sino Global, Dentsu Ventures, Greenoaks Capital, and O'Leary Ventures.\n&nbsp;\nWhat makes Sui Different From Other Blockchains?\nHere are the key features that make Sui unique among other L1 blockchains:\nObject-based design\nSui's object-based design is a foundational principle differentiating it from traditional blockchain architectures. In Sui, all on-chain data, including user accounts, tokens, and smart contracts, are treated as objects. These objects have a unique structure and are managed with Sui's Move-based programming language. Here’s how the design works:\nObjects and Ownership\nIn Sui, every piece of data is represented as an object, uniquely identified by an Object ID. Objects can be immutable or mutable. These objects are either owned by an account (private ownership) or are shared across the network (shared ownership). Private objects are associated with a single owner, and operations on them are simpler and more efficient since they don’t require consensus. Shared objects require consensus for operations. They are used for use cases like decentralized applications where multiple participants interact with the same data.\nObject States\nEach object maintains its state and versioning. When an object is modified, a new version is created while retaining the previous versions for transparency and traceability.\nMove Programming Model\nSui developers use the Move programming language to define object types, rules, and methods. Move enforces strict safety and guarantees around object ownership and state transitions. For instance, a token in Sui would be defined as a Move object with methods to transfer, mint, or burn.\n&nbsp;\nBenefits of Sui's Object-Based Design\nHere are the key benefits of Sui's innovative object-based design:\n&nbsp;\nScalability: Sui's ability to execute transactions in parallel, thanks to the separation of independent objects, enables high throughput and low latency.\nModularity: The self-contained nature of objects makes it simpler to develop, modify, and maintain applications.\nSecurity: Clear ownership rules and state transitions help minimize the risk of errors and vulnerabilities.\nFlexibility: Developers can create intricate interactions between objects while benefiting from efficient execution for independent transactions.\n&nbsp;\nTransaction Processing on Sui\n‍The Sui Blockchain processes transactions in two main ways: single-owner and shared object transactions. Understanding these types is vital to understanding how Sui handles data and runs smart contracts efficiently.\nSingle-owner transactions are actions one address takes, like creating new tokens or launching smart contracts. Only one party controls these transactions, and they initiate all the actions.\nOn the other hand, shared object transactions involve multiple addresses working together for a common goal, such as joining an auction. In these cases, all parties must agree and confirm the transaction&nbsp;\nThe process of completing a Sui transaction involves the following steps:&nbsp;\nUser submission: A user starts a transaction and sends it to a full node in the Sui network.\nValidation and broadcasting: The full node checks if the transaction is valid and shares it with a group of validators.\nSignature gathering: The validators sign the transaction to create a certificate that proves it is valid.\nCertificate broadcast: This certificate is sent out to more validators for additional verification.\n&nbsp;Unlike many L1s that deal with transactions one after another, Sui uses its object-oriented design to run transactions simultaneously. This means that transactions occur simultaneously instead of waiting for one to finish before starting the next.\nThis parallel execution has two main benefits: it makes transaction processing faster and helps prevent network congestion. By validating and sharing transactions individually instead of in groups, Sui can keep the network running smoothly, even when there is a lot of activity.\n&nbsp;\nSui's Proof-of-Stake Consensus\nThe Sui Blockchain uses a proof-of-stake (PoS) system for its staking program. This method is vital for securing the network and validating transactions. PoS is popular because it uses less energy and is better for the environment than proof-of-work (PoW) systems.\nIn Sui, the consensus mechanism depends on token holders to help maintain the network. Token holders can delegate their Sui tokens to validators, who confirm transactions and maintain the blockchain's integrity.\nSui’s consensus system has two key components: Narwhal and Bullshark. These components help the PoS system run smoothly.\nNarwhal helps solve a common problem in blockchain networks: slow transaction processing during high demand. It acts as a fast memory pool, speeding up transaction processing and improving efficiency. Narwhal also ensures that Bullshark, the consensus engine, is ready to use data.\nBullshark uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerance mechanism to verify the legitimacy of transactions and distribute them throughout the network. This crucial component is essential for maintaining a consensus and safeguarding the security and reliability of the Sui Blockchain.\nThis approach supports Sui's goal of creating a strong and high-performing blockchain ecosystem for various Web3 applications.‍\n&nbsp;\nTokenomics of Sui\nSui’s tokenomics are designed to support its blockchain ecosystem, reward contributors, and maintain network stability. Here’s a detailed breakdown of Sui tokenomics\nAs of December 23, 2024, the Sui (SUI) coin has the following key metrics:\nCirculating supply: Approximately 2.9 billion Sui tokens are currently in circulation, representing about 29% of the total supply of 10 billion tokens.\n\nFully Diluted Valuation (FDV): With a total supply of 10 billion tokens and a current price of around $4.13 per SUI, the FDV is approximately $41.3 billion.\n\nMarket capitalization: The current market cap is approximately $12.66 billion, placing $SUI among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap.\n\nToken unlock schedule: Sui follows a structured token release schedule with significant monthly unlocks. On December 3, 2024, a substantial token unlock valued at approximately $215 million occurred, increasing the circulating supply.\n\nStaking participation: A notable portion of SUI is staked within the network. Interestingly, the staked amount exceeds the circulating supply due to the Sui Foundation staking locked and non-circulating tokens. As of recent data, approximately 7.83 billion SUI are staked, indicating a high staking ratio.\n\nUtility\nSUI is used to pay transaction fees.\nGas fees incentivize validators to process transactions and maintain network integrity. The fees are dynamically adjusted based on network demand.\nToken holders can stake SUI to participate in the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Stakers earn rewards proportional to their stake, derived from transaction fees.\nDelegators can assign their tokens to validators and earn a share of staking rewards. Part of the gas fees goes into a storage fund to compensate validators for long-term storage costs.\nSUI holders can participate in governance by voting on protocol upgrades, network parameters, and other key decisions.\nSUI facilitates the transfer of value within the ecosystem, including payments for services or goods in decentralized applications (dApps).\n&nbsp;\nSUI Token Allocation\nThe fixed supply of 10 billion SUI is distributed as follows:\nCategory\nPercentage\nPurpose\nCommunity Reserve\n~50%\nGrants, ecosystem development, and community incentives.\nEarly Contributors\n~20%\nReward for developers, builders, and early network contributors.\nInvestors\n~14%\nSupporters and investors who provided funding in the early stages.\nMysten Labs Treasury\n~10%\nReserved for core team members and long-term project sustainability.\nPublic Sale\n~6%\nAvailable to the public during token sales or auctions.\n&nbsp;\nToken Release Schedule\nSui (SUI) has a structured token release schedule for 2025, with significant unlock events planned throughout the year. Here's an overview of the upcoming token unlocks:\nJanuary 1, 2025\nUnlock Amount: Approximately 64.19 million SUI.\nPercentage of Total Supply: 0.64%.\nEstimated Value: $296 million based on current market prices.\n&nbsp;\nJanuary 3, 2025\nUnlock Amount: Approximately 74.1 million SUI.\nPercentage of Total Supply: 0.74%.\nEstimated Value: $333 million based on current market prices.\n&nbsp;\nSubsequent Monthly Unlocks\nFrequency: Monthly scheduled throughout 2025.\nUnlock Amount: Varies per month; specific details can be found on platforms like CryptoRank .\nPurpose: These unlocks are part of the vesting schedules for various stakeholders, including early contributors, investors, and community reserves.\nSignificant token unlocks can influence supply and demand, potentially affecting SUI's market price. Investors should monitor these unlock events and consider their potential impact on the market.&nbsp;\n\nFor detailed information on unlock dates and amounts, refer to the official Sui documentation and reputable tracking platforms.\n&nbsp;\nDeflationary measures\nGas fees are partially burned, reducing the circulating supply of SUI over time. Burning creates a deflationary pressure, balancing the fixed supply. The storage fund mechanism ensures validators are compensated fairly without inflating the token supply.\n&nbsp;\nWhich dApps run on the Sui network?\nSui's ecosystem supports various applications that make digital interactions simpler and more efficient. The platform currently powers:\nDecentralized finance applications\nLending and borrowing platforms\nAutomated market makers\nYield farming protocols\nGaming platforms with real-time transactions\nPlayer owned assets\nInstant rewards distribution\nSeamless in-game trading\n&nbsp;\nSui network performance and growth\nThe Sui community represents a diverse group of users across multiple sectors. Regular traders comprise the largest segment at 45%, followed by DeFi participants at 30%. NFT collectors account for 15% of the user base, while gamers represent 10%. These numbers reflect growing adoption across different use cases, with new users joining daily through various entry points.\n&nbsp;\nHow to buy $SUI\nGetting started with SUI involves a straightforward process:\nChoose a compatible cryptocurrency exchange.\nCreate and verify your account.\nAdd funds through bank transfer or credit card.\nPlace an order to buy SUI.\nTransfer tokens to your Tangem Wallet.\n&nbsp;\nWhich crypto wallets support SUI?\nSeveral secure wallet options exist for storing SUI:\nThe official Sui wallet provides specialized features designed specifically for the ecosystem.\nUsers requiring maximum security often choose hardware wallets like Tangem Wallet for long-term storage.\nMobile wallets offer convenient access to daily transactions.\nWeb-based wallets seamlessly integrate with decentralized applications (dApps).\nEach wallet type serves different user needs while maintaining consistent security standards.\n&nbsp;\nSecurity and risk factors\nSui's security is based on multiple layers of protection that work together. The Move programming language's design provides a strong foundation for security. Meanwhile, validator networks continuously monitor transactions.\nRegular security audits and community bug bounty programs add even more layers of protection. As a result, Sui has a comprehensive security framework that effectively protects user assets.\n&nbsp;\nFinal\nSui is a groundbreaking advancement in blockchain technology. Its distinctive object-based design and efficient transaction processing make it a standout choice for developers and users. The platform successfully combines high-security standards with user-friendly features, creating a robust ecosystem that benefits both parties. As its adoption grows, Sui proves its worth through its reliable performance and ever-expanding capabilities.\n\nAuthors Tangem team\nWe are a team of Tangem Wallet users dedicated to simplifying self-custody for everyone.\n\nEnglish\nFrançais\nEspañol\n日本語\nEnglish\n\nDon't miss these  Other articles\n\nPatrick Dike-Ndulue •Jul 7, 2025\nHow to Manage NFTs in Your Tangem Wallet: A Complete Guide\n\nNFT\n\nTangem team •Jun 27, 2023\nPassive income with crypto: More than just trading\n\nBlockchain\nToken\nStaking\nNFT\nGameFi\n\nTangem team •Apr 12, 2023\nWhat are NFTs and why are they relevant in 2023?

At its core, Sui leverages a novel object-centric data model and the secure Move programming language to address inefficiencies prevalent in existing blockchain architectures.\nOn top of strong technical foundations, Sui prioritizes user experience by eliminating barriers commonly associated with blockchain interactions. Through innovations like zkLogin, sponsored transactions, and programmable transaction blocks, Sui creates a higher standard for user experience within Web3 by ensuring applications are accessible and user-friendly.\n\nWho Are the Founders of Sui?\n\nMysten Labs, the original contributor to Sui, was founded by former lead architects of Meta’s blockchain research team:\nEvan Cheng, CEO of Mysten Labs, has an extensive background in platform development, with more than 24 years building developer-facing technology and leading engineering teams at companies such as Apple and Facebook.\nAdeniyi Abiodun, CPO of Mysten Labs, has led engineering and product teams across Big Tech companies including Oracle, VMware and Facebook. He has led product teams within the blockchain industry for over 10 years.\nSam Blackshear, CTO of Mysten Labs, is a researcher and engineer specializing in programming language design, program verification, and developer tools. He is the creator of the Move smart contract language.\nGeorge Danezis, Chief Scientist of Mysten Labs, is a Professor of Security and Privacy Engineering at University College London with over 20 years of experience working on peer-to-peer system security and privacy.\nKostas Chalkias - Chief Cryptographer of Mysten Labs, has over 10 years of experience in lead cryptographer roles in many big tech companies, including Meta and R3.\n\nWhat Makes Sui Unique?\n\nSui’s innovative architecture offers low-latency transactions with stable transaction fees, high throughput through horizontal scaling and parallelized execution, and empowers developers with powerful capabilities and tools to craft the next generation of Web3 applications.\nAt the heart of Sui's uniqueness lies its object-oriented design, offering a new way of developing on blockchain. Offering powerful capabilities in a way that ensures deep composability with important developer and user safety measures. As everything on Sui is an object, the ability to define object types allow developers to create objects tailored to their application needs with inherent network-wide compatibility. This changes how assets and protocols can work together to create greater products with broad composability.\nDramatic improvements to crucial network processes, such as transaction processing, are enabled by the use of objects on Sui. By having explicitly defined transaction dependencies transactions on Sui are able to be executed in parallel. Along with this, Sui has unique consensus requirements that allow specific transactions to actually bypass consensus and be completed significantly faster. Many transactions are finalized and settled in less than half a second all while maintaining high throughput and stable transaction fees.\nApplication builders benefit from Sui’s focus to provide solutions that overcome common barriers in Web3 adoptions. This is accomplished through tools natively available for all developers such as zkLogin and sponsored transactions addressing barriers such as wallet onboarding and transaction fees, respectively.\nFinally, Move on Sui has been tailored to Sui’s object-oriented data model creating a development platform that combines a new yet intuitive platform with a powerful and secure programming language. This allows both developers and users to rest easier knowing that the additional safety measures required by Move on Sui help to mitigate, if not entirely eliminate, the most common exploits in other smart contract developing languages.\nWith Sui Wallet and zkLogin, you can onboard Sui immediately! zkLogin allows you to create and manage Sui accounts with a simple web login like Google. Using zero-knowledge cryptography, zkLogin brings the convenience of using a familiar web account to all the benefits around security and ownership that blockchain technology provides. Download Sui Wallet and get started today.\n\nHow Many Sui (SUI) Coins Are There in Circulation?\n\nThe SUI token has a total supply capped at 10,000,000,000 (ten billion tokens) and is primarily used to secure the network and act as a unit of account and payment within the network.\nThe SUI token currently serves three primary purposes on Sui:\nProof-of-stake participation - Sui uses a delegated proof-of-stake mechanism to select, incentivize, and reward honest behavior by Sui validators and the SUI token owners that stake with them.\nGas fee payments - SUI tokens are used to pay for gas fees required to execute transactions and store data onchain.\nUtility across applications - SUI is a versatile and liquid asset that can be used for various applications within Sui’s ecosystem, such as decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing applications, games, and much more.\nGovernance - The SUI token will play a crucial role in future governance of Sui by granting holders the right to participate in onchain voting on important issues, such as protocol upgrades and changes to the platform.\nAdditionally, the Sui storage fund is used to shift stake rewards across time and compensate future validators for storage costs of previously stored onchain data. This tokenomic design creates a mechanism for users to store data onchain indefinitely while compensating current and future validators fairly for storage, ensuring long-term sustainability.\n\nHow Is the Sui Network Secured?\n\nSui uses a delegated proof of stake (PoS) mechanism to secure the network from sybil attacks, where validators and delegators take on acts similarly to other dPoS mechanisms.\nThe unique element of Sui’s network level architecture is the protocols leading to consensus. Narwhal is the protocol developed to create and efficiently manage a mempool for a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which Sui uses. Bullshark, the consensus protocol, then pulls transactions from the Narwhal mempool to validate and finalize transactions. As mentioned above, certain transactions can actually by-pass the consensus mechanism and follow the Byzentine Consistent Broadcast mechanism to achieve finality in less than half a second with true settlement guarantees.\nThis network design has shown to reach transaction speeds of over 297,000 transactions per second in a testing environment.\n\nWhere Can You Buy Sui (SUI)?\n\nSUI can be purchased on numerous centralized exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Bybit, Kraken, Bitfinex and more.\n\nWhat is SuiNS?\n\nAs a name service platform, SuiNS assigns identifiers on Sui, such as alice.sui. These identifiers, referred to as names, are linked to Sui accounts, streamlining transactions by directing them to the associated Sui account. This simplifies the process of specifying Sui accounts for users, enhancing their overall experience.\nSuiNS names are represented as NFTs and stored in the user's wallet, ensuring that ownership benefits, inherent to Sui objects, extend to SuiNS names as well. Moreover, SuiNS offers additional personalization options by allowing users to associate avatars with their names. These avatars, also NFTs, leverage Sui's support for composable objects, offering users a multitude of possibilities for their graphical representations. In addition to avatars, SuiNS supports IPFS websites, enabling users to create either straightforward informational pages or intricate, dynamic sites.\n\nRelated Pages:\n\nDeFi Projects on SUI:\nTurbos Finance concentrated liquidity, hyper-efficient decentralized exchange allowing users to trade assets at great prices and earn rewards by providing liquidity.\n\nBlueFin decentralized derivatives exchange that offers high performance, low costs, and a Web2-like user experience.\n\nAftermath an all-in-one platform for trading, liquid staking, and earning yield that is fast, inexpensive, and fully transparent.\n\nKriya a vertically-integrated range of DeFi products meant to aggregate liquidity, enhance capital efficiency, and offer tools specifically for institutions and whales.\n\nSudo Finance real world asset &amp; derivatives exchange protocol allowing high leverage trading with zero slippage.\n\nNAVI borrow and lending protocol on Sui, enabling users to participate as liquidity providers and borrowers with powerful features such as automatic leverage vaults.\n\nCetus Protocol a decentralized exchange and concentrated liquidity protocol built on the Sui utilizing a flexible underlying liquidity network to make trading easier for any user.\n\nNFTs on Sui:\nNFT marketplace providing access to Sui assets include Hyperspace and Tradeport, among others.\nCheck out Aptos (APT) — a blockchain built on the Move language too.\nRead more on the “Aptos and Sui: The New Kids on the Block” report.\nRead about the best enterprise-grade DApps.\nGet the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSUI Price Prediction - What could affect SUI’s future price?\nRevolut Crypto Quiz Answers (Learn &amp; Earn Program) 2025\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nICO\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSimilar Coins to Sui\n\nPopular Tokens on the Sui Network Chain\n\nWalrus\nWAL\n$0.40441.48%DeepBook Protocol\nDEEP\n$0.14281.60%Cetus Protocol\nCETUS\n$0.091095.02%LOFI\nLOFI\n$0.028295.19%Bluefin\nBLUE\n$0.081040.91%Sui Name Service\nNS\n$0.12366.22%Scallop\nSCA\n$0.12771.13%XOCIETY\nXO\n$0.007210.79%DRIFE\n$DRF\n$0.000088159.26%LumiWave\nLWA\n$0.019524.20%Toilet Dust\nTOILET\n$0.00012336.77%Chirp\nCHIRP\n$0.071771.54%DeLorean\nDMC\n$0.0056975.10%Suilend\nSEND\n$0.43692.43%NAVI Protocol\nNAVX\n$0.042225.35%UNI\nUNI\n$0.0004684.83%SEED\nSEED\n$0.0014843.67%Suilama\nSUILAMA\n$0.0000041812.28%KOBAN\nKOBAN\n$0.0017632.02%MemeFi\nMEMEFI\n$0.0011333.27%\n\nMost Visited Cryptocurrencies\n\nBridge AI\nBRG\n$0.00011678.60%Bitcoin\nBTC\n$108,600.310.17%XRP\nXRP\n$2.342.25%Ethereum\nETH\n$2,610.662.34%Solana\nSOL\n$152.571.48%Pi\nPI\n$0.46131.18%Dark Eclipse\nDARK\n$0.0026920.82%Solaxy\nSOLX\n$0.00101911.11%Cronos\nCRO\n$0.0963518.89%Pepe\nPEPE\n$0.000010192.47%Shiba Inu\nSHIB\n$0.000011931.49%America Party\nAMERICA\n$0.00347412069.30%Bonk\nBONK\n$0.000021546.24%Cardano\nADA\n$0.59312.28%Dogecoin\nDOGE\n$0.17141.66%Hedera\nHBAR\n$0.16465.00%Chainlink\nLINK\n$14.075.89%Kaspa\nKAS\n$0.078364.72%FLOKI\nFLOKI\n$0.0000926211.23%\n\nGlobal  Prices\n\nSUI/EUR\nEuro\n€2.50SUI/GBP\nPound Sterling\n£2.16SUI/CNY\nChinese Yuan\n¥21.05SUI/CAD\nCanadian Dollar\n$4.01SUI/AUD\nAustralian Dollar\n$4.49SUI/JPY\nJapanese Yen\n¥429.93SUI/KRW\nSouth Korean Won\n₩4,035.63SUI/RUB\nRussian Ruble\n₽229.26SUI/INR\nIndian Rupee\n₹251.36SUI/BRL\nBrazilian Real\nR$15.99SUI/TRY\nTurkish Lira\n₺117.40SUI/PHP\nPhilippine Peso\n₱165.64SUI/PKR\nPakistani Rupee\n₨834.06SUI/USDT\nTether USDT\n2.9315 USDT\n\nTrending\n\nTreasure$0.2095\n77.42%\n\nBanana For Scale$0.02061\n34.44%\n\nChainlink$14.07\n5.83%\n\nHeroes of Mavia$0.1699\n30.25%\n\nFLOKI$0.00009262\n11.38%\n\nSui Price Live Data\n\nThe live Sui price today is $2.93 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $545,033,457 USD.

Launched in 2023 as the 25th project on KuCoin Spotlight, Sui captured early investor attention with its efficient infrastructure and ability to support a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps). Its architecture, built around the Move programming language, emphasizes scalability and low-latency operations, allowing developers to create robust applications across DeFi, gaming, and social ecosystems.\n\nWith a focus on high throughput and interoperability, Sui has grown rapidly, attracting developers and users alike. As of October 2024, it has reached $5.7 billion in market capitalization, placing it among the top 20 cryptocurrencies globally. The platform’s low gas fees and seamless integration with dApps have positioned it as a serious contender in the web3 space. Additionally, Sui's recent partnerships and developments—such as the launch of native USDC to enhance liquidity—underscore its momentum in the DeFi sector. As a result, the network continues to gain traction, empowering users with advanced blockchain tools while setting the stage for further expansion.\n\nSui Market Performance and Ecosystem Expansion in 2024\n\nSui TVL | Source: DefiLlama&nbsp;\n\nThroughout 2024, the Sui blockchain has achieved significant milestones, including a new all-time high (ATH) surpassing $2 per token. Its DeFi sector has seen explosive growth, with Total Value Locked (TVL) surpassing $1 billion in October, marking a dramatic rise from just over $200 million at the start of the year. Sui now boasts nearly 200 dApps, spanning DeFi, infrastructure, gaming, security, and social applications.\n\nOne of the most pivotal updates this year was the launch of native USDC on the Sui network. Introduced in October 2024 through a partnership with Circle, the integration streamlines liquidity and reduces reliance on bridged assets. The use of Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) further boosts interoperability, allowing seamless movement of USDC across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and others. This addition not only enhances transaction efficiency but also unlocks new possibilities for DeFi protocols on Sui, including DeepBook, Cetus, and other leading platforms.&nbsp;\n\nSui’s ecosystem has become increasingly attractive for developers, with the USDC integration immediately benefiting its dApps and liquidity protocols. This stablecoin’s presence allows DeFi applications to offer improved liquidity and more secure user experiences, reinforcing Sui's ambition to become a hub for decentralized finance and gaming.&nbsp;\n\nAdditionally, Sui continues to excel in cross-chain interoperability. With the introduction of CCTP, developers gain access to seamless multi-chain functionality, enhancing Sui’s connectivity with both Web3 networks and traditional finance systems.&nbsp;\n\nWith 200+ dApps now active, and stablecoins like USDY and USDC driving liquidity, Sui’s ecosystem is poised for further expansion. Upcoming features include advanced social platforms, DePIN solutions like Chirp, and new gaming experiences such as Blockus, solidifying Sui's role in leading Web3 innovation.\n\nTop Projects in the Sui Ecosystem\n\nHere’s a look at some of the most trending crypto projects in the Sui ecosystem to explore, based on their utility, popularity, and growth potential:&nbsp;\n\nDeFi: DeepBook\n\nDeepBook is a core decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure on the Sui blockchain, functioning as a fully on-chain central limit order book (CLOB). This platform, integrated deeply into Sui’s protocol, offers efficient liquidity services for institutional traders and DeFi protocols by handling all order matching, routing, and settlement on-chain. Designed as a public good, DeepBook enables liquidity providers and traders to execute strategies with low latency and low gas fees, contributing significantly to the growth of Sui’s TVL, which now exceeds $1 billion.\n\nThe launch of DeepBook version 3 on October 14, 2024, marked a key milestone, accompanied by the introduction of the native DEEP token. This update enhances governance by allowing token holders to participate in network decisions, stake their tokens, and enjoy reduced trading fees. The platform underwent extensive testing on the Sui testnet, recording over 1.1 million trades from 115,000 wallets within a short span, highlighting its importance within the DeFi landscape. DeepBook aims to become the primary venue for wholesale liquidity within the Sui ecosystem, facilitating seamless, high-performance trading for institutional participants and everyday users alike. This positioning underscores its significance as a foundation for Sui’s DeFi growth and innovation going forward.&nbsp;\n\nMemecoin: sudeng (HIPPO)\n\nsudeng (HIPPO) is a flagship memecoin on the Sui blockchain, inspired by a hippo named Su Deng, which gained popularity online in 2024. The token has become a community-driven initiative, focusing not only on fun and engagement typical of memecoins but also on philanthropy. A portion of its revenues goes towards wildlife conservation efforts, with initial contributions supporting the Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand, where the real-life Su Deng resides. This blend of meme culture and charitable initiatives has drawn strong community support, helping HIPPO thrive within Sui's expanding memecoin landscape.\n\nLaunched in 2024 during the memecoin boom, sudeng quickly captured attention, achieving substantial liquidity on Sui’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It reached an all-time high price of $0.0143 on October 7, 2024, reflecting heightened market interest. The token’s success has contributed to Sui’s growing trading volume, alongside other popular tokens on the network. HIPPO offers investors the chance to engage in a playful, yet purposeful project, demonstrating how memecoins on Sui are evolving beyond mere speculation to include community-building and impact-driven goals.\n\nCheck out other top Sui mememcoins beyond sudeng.&nbsp;\n\nInfrastructure: Sui Name Service (SuiNS)&nbsp;\n\nThe Sui Name Service (SuiNS) is a blockchain-based naming platform designed to simplify user interactions on the Sui network. Launched officially on the Sui mainnet in May 2023, SuiNS allows users to register human-readable identifiers that replace complex alphanumeric wallet addresses. These identifiers, such as \"@john,\" make it easier to manage on-chain transactions and interact within the ecosystem. SuiNS names are issued as NFTs, ensuring ownership rights are tied to users' wallets, and they can also be used for functions like setting avatars or associating with decentralized websites.&nbsp;\n\nA major development in 2024 was the introduction of SuiNS V2 in June, which transitioned the naming format from “john.sui” to more familiar '@' identifiers, enhancing usability. Additionally, SuiNS began offering Subnames, allowing hierarchical identity structures under a primary name, a feature beneficial for organizations and individual users alike. In August 2024, SuiNS announced a shift to decentralized governance, empowering the community to influence the platform’s future via the $NS token. This transition aligns with Sui's broader goals of decentralization, enhancing user participation through governance rewards and long-term engagement incentives. The SuiNS airdrop took place in September 2024, as part of Sui's broader push toward decentralization and community engagement. This airdrop rewarded early holders of SuiNS names with NS tokens and soul-bound NFTs, incentivizing participation in governance activities.&nbsp;\n\nWallet: Sui Wallet\n\nThe Sui Wallet is the official non-custodial wallet of the Sui blockchain, designed to help users manage their SUI tokens, interact with dApps, and stake assets seamlessly. Launched alongside the Sui mainnet in May 2023, it quickly became essential for ecosystem participants, offering smooth integration with DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and staking services. The wallet supports token transfers and allows users to store NFTs and other digital assets natively on the Sui blockchain.\n\nA key development in 2024 was the integration with Transak, which enabled direct fiat-to-crypto onboarding within the wallet. This addition has significantly boosted transaction volumes, with Transak reporting a 300% month-over-month increase in usage by September 2024. The seamless purchase of SUI tokens through credit cards, bank transfers, and other payment options has simplified user onboarding, contributing to the rapid growth of the Sui ecosystem. The Sui Wallet's role extends beyond storage, as it supports staking and governance activities, enhancing user participation across the blockchain network.&nbsp;\n\nDEX: Cetus Protocol (CETUS)\n\nCetus Protocol is a DEX operating on both the Sui and Aptos blockchains, with its primary focus on delivering efficient liquidity infrastructure through concentrated liquidity pools. Launched to support Sui’s growing DeFi ecosystem, Cetus Protocol offers advanced functionalities like limit orders, swap options, and range orders, ensuring minimal slippage during trades. Its innovative liquidity market-making model attracts liquidity providers by offering competitive rewards, making it a key contributor to Sui's rapid rise in (TVL, which reached a record $200 million in October 2024.&nbsp;\n\nThroughout 2024, Cetus has expanded its offerings and partnerships, adding new features like Cetus Vaults and New Farms, further enhancing trading efficiency. It also became the leading DEX on the Sui blockchain, accounting for almost all of the platform’s TVL growth. Notably, its CETUS token provides governance rights and liquidity rewards, fostering user engagement within the ecosystem. Cetus has also played a role in the broader DeFi landscape by integrating DeepBook’s liquidity, contributing to seamless asset swaps and deeper liquidity management across Sui’s ecosystem.&nbsp;\n\nLaunchpad: SuiPad (SUIP)\n\nSuiPad is a community-focused launchpad designed to support innovative blockchain projects on the Sui network through Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs). Launched officially in Q2 2023 after completing testnet trials, SuiPad offers users the opportunity to participate in token sales for vetted Tier-1 projects by staking its native SUIP tokens. With partnerships such as those with Mysten Labs, SuiPad ensures only high-quality projects are selected, enhancing trust and credibility within its ecosystem.\n\nIn 2024, SuiPad introduced unique features like the SuiTank series, a Shark Tank-style reality show where project founders pitch to venture capitalists, offering both entertainment and education to the community. Additionally, the platform launched SuiPad Shield, an innovative insurance pool that helps protect participants' capital by covering losses if token prices fall below IDO levels within a set timeframe. These developments have cemented SuiPad’s role as a key facilitator of Sui's ecosystem growth, providing users with access to early-stage projects and fostering a more secure investment environment.\n\nStablecoin: Ondo US Dollar Yield (USDY)\n\nThe Ondo US Dollar Yield (USDY) is a yield-bearing stablecoin launched on the Sui blockchain in October 2024. Backed by U.S. Treasuries, USDY is designed to provide both price stability and predictable daily yields, making it an ideal asset for DeFi applications such as liquidity provision and lending. As the first native dollar-denominated token on Sui, USDY aims to enhance capital efficiency by allowing users to earn yield while participating in other financial activities like borrowing or staking on protocols such as NAVI within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nThe integration of USDY has been instrumental in boosting Sui’s DeFi growth, aligning with the network's push toward attracting more financial use cases. Users can leverage USDY as collateral without forfeiting its yield, promoting seamless liquidity management and lending. This launch follows Ondo Finance’s broader strategy of bringing real-world assets onto blockchain networks, reinforcing Sui’s growing reputation as a hub for innovative DeFi solutions.&nbsp;\n\nDePIN: Chirp\n\nChirp is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN) built on the Sui blockchain, designed to revolutionize IoT connectivity and telecommunications. Launched on March 15, 2024, with its testnet debut, Chirp aims to connect IoT devices to blockchain applications through a multi-protocol wireless network. It provides seamless integration for various communication protocols, including LoRaWAN, 5G, and IoT cellular networks, far surpassing the capabilities of existing decentralized networks like Helium. The Chirp network features a CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) platform, enabling businesses to onboard devices efficiently and leverage blockchain-backed infrastructure for data transfer and connectivity.\n\nChirp’s network infrastructure includes BlackBird devices, which act as gateways connecting over 1,500 IoT devices globally. As of October 2024, the network has already deployed Radio Access Network (RAN) nodes in 30 countries, laying the foundation for further mobile and broadband capabilities. The project focuses on expanding decentralized telecommunications while prioritizing IoT device compatibility, privacy, and user ownership. Future milestones include the mainnet launch and the introduction of mobile services, ensuring that Chirp continues to set new standards in blockchain-based telecommunications and IoT integration. Its innovative approach positions Chirp as a leader in decentralized infrastructure development within the Sui ecosystem.\n\nExplore other top DePIN projects in the crypto market.&nbsp;\n\nOracle: Supra\n\nSupra Oracle is a decentralized oracle service integrated into the Sui blockchain, providing fast, secure, and reliable access to real-world data for smart contracts. Supra's technology ensures that dApps on Sui receive real-time data with sub-second latency, crucial for DeFi applications, lending protocols, and derivatives trading. It supports over 80 blockchain networks, including both EVM-compatible and non-EVM chains, making it highly interoperable and suitable for multi-chain ecosystems.\n\nIn 2024, Supra introduced significant updates, including Distributed Oracle Agreement (DORA) 2.0, which enhances the accuracy and integrity of real-world asset (RWA) price feeds. This feature allows blockchain-based applications to tap into data streams for commodities, equities, and FX markets, enabling seamless interactions between decentralized and traditional finance. Supra’s presence on the Sui blockchain further strengthens Sui’s infrastructure, empowering developers to build reliable and scalable financial products while ensuring data integrity through advanced consensus mechanisms.&nbsp;\n\nCheck out other leading decentralized oracle networks in the crypto market.&nbsp;\n\nGaming: Blockus\n\nBlockus is a Web3 gaming ecosystem built on the Sui blockchain, launched to enhance game development by integrating blockchain technology with interactive gameplay mechanics. In March 2024, Blockus secured $4 million in pre-seed funding, following its participation in the a16z Crypto Startup Accelerator, which provided it with strategic mentorship and connections. The platform empowers game studios by offering tools to incorporate in-game tokenized assets, NFTs, and decentralized commerce seamlessly.\n\nIn 2024, Blockus expanded partnerships with over 30 studios, aiming to streamline development and onboard more players. Its mission is to redefine gaming by providing immersive experiences and enabling players to truly own and trade their in-game assets, positioning Blockus as a leader in the GameFi sector.\n\nFind out more about other popular play-to-earn games in the crypto market.&nbsp;\n\nFuture Trends and Innovations in the Sui Ecosystem\n\nLooking forward, Sui is poised to maintain its momentum through continuous innovation. The network is expanding into cross-chain solutions with its upcoming bridge to Ethereum, aiming to attract more liquidity and dApp developers. With low gas fees and scalable infrastructure, Sui remains an appealing platform for DeFi, GameFi, and enterprise applications.\n\nThe DePIN and AI integrations introduced in 2024 indicate Sui’s ambition to explore new frontiers in blockchain technology.

The funded project, titled “COMET: Comparative Metrics and Framework for Transitioning to Sui Move,” aims to enhance the understanding of blockchain technology by examining smart contract programming languages.\n\nProject Overview\n\nThe COMET project intends to study the relationship between the Ethereum Solidity and the SUI Move programming languages. The goal is to provide insights that could help in assessing the potential of emerging technologies in blockchain programming.\n\nResearch Focus\n\nThe research will concentrate on:\n\nComparative Analysis: Evaluating the operational capabilities and challenges of different programming languages to better understand their practical applications.\n\nFramework Development: Creating a framework to aid developers in grasping and utilizing new blockchain technologies effectively.\n\nKnowledge Dissemination: Sharing the research findings through academic and industry channels to enrich the broader blockchain community’s understanding.\n\nAlignment with SUI Foundation’s Objectives\n\nThis project aligns with the SUI Foundation’s objectives to support the development of secure and efficient web3 applications. The insights gained from this study are expected to contribute modestly to the blockchain ecosystem and support the Foundation’s goal of enhancing developer and researcher engagement with new technologies.\n\n“We are excited to embark on this project with the SUI Foundation and contribute our research efforts towards the evolution of Sui blockchain technology,” remarked Dr. Leonidas Katelaris, Managing Director at the Distributed Ledgers Research Centre (DLRC-UNIC), while Prof. Christos K. Georgiadis (Dept. of Applied Informatics-UOM), commented: “Our research will be aligned with the mission of supporting the web3 technology in terms of creating secure applications, while at the same time, engaging more developers to the blockchain ecosystem”.\n\nExpected Impact\n\nThe project seeks to deepen understanding within the academic and development communities about blockchain technology, potentially helping developers to explore and adopt new programming languages for blockchain applications.\n\nAbout the University of Nicosia\n\nUNIC has an almost decade-long track record as the leading university in the field of cryptocurrency and blockchain, having launched the world’s first degree programme in cryptocurrency in 2014. Today, UNIC has educated over 100,000 students in academic and professional training courses, while hosting the world’s largest team of faculty and staff focused on crypto-assets and blockchains. UNIC serves as the academic lead for the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum (EUBOF), a European Commission initiative to accelerate the development of blockchain within the EU.\n\nUNIC has also been the first to deliver an on-chain course in the metaverse that amassed over 20,000 registrants shortly after its launch. The “NFTs &amp; the Metaverse” course was honored with the ‘Most Exciting Project in Education’ award organized by the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) in 2023. In the same year, UNIC launched the world’s first accredited graduate degree programme focused on Metaverse, a ground-breaking programme designed to equip students with the knowledge and skills required for careers in metaverse design and management.\n\nAbout the University of Macedonia\n\nThe vision of the University of Macedonia (Thessaloniki, Greece) is to provide excellent education, promote the advancement of science in the broader spectrum of economic and social sciences and arts, and in a broader view to advance education and culture by pursuing excellence in a socially sensitive and inclusive manner. The main purpose and goal of the University’s Dept. of Applied Informatics is to promote and transmit knowledge through teaching and research in the field of Computer Science with particular emphasis on the development of systems for their application in Economics, Finance, Management, and other social sciences. The team that will participate from the University of Macedonia, Dept. of Applied Informatics in the above project consists of Prof. Christos K. Georgiadis and PhD candidate Antonios Giatzis.\n\nchristoforou2024-05-29T10:00:09+03:00May 21st, 2024|Distributed Ledgers Research Centre (DLRC), Institute For the Future (IFF), News|\n\nShare This, Choose Your Platform!\n\nFacebookXRedditLinkedInTumblrPinterestVkEmail\n\nSearch\n\nSearch for:\n\nEvents Calendar\n\n35 events found.\n\nJuly 2025\n\nCalendar of Events\n\nM\n\nMon\n\nT\n\nTue\n\nW\n\nWed\n\nT\n\nThu\n\nF\n\nFri\n\nS\n\nSat\n\nS\n\nSun\n\n5 events,\n\n30\n\n5 events,\n\n30\n\n2025-05-12\n\nPortfolio Competition | “Creativity and Innovative Ideas” for the Programmes of study in Architecture and Interior Design\n\nPortfolio Competition | “Creativity and Innovative Ideas” for the Programmes of study in Architecture and Interior Design\n\n12 May - 29 August\n\nPortfolio Competition | “Creativity and Innovative Ideas” for the Programmes of study in Architecture and Interior Design\n\nGet the chance to win scholarships for the programme of study of Architecture or Interior Design\n\n12:00\n-\n\n19:30\n\nΔια ζώσης συναντήσεις με το Πανεπιστήμιο Λευκωσίας στη Θεσσαλονίκη – Προγράμματα Μηχανικής\n\n30 June @ 12:00 - 19:30  EEST\n\nΔια ζώσης συναντήσεις με το Πανεπιστήμιο Λευκωσίας στη Θεσσαλονίκη – Προγράμματα Μηχανικής\n\nΤο Γραφείο Ενημέρωσης και Εγγραφών του Πανεπιστημίου Λευκωσίας ανακοινώνει την έναρξη κύκλου δια ζώσης συναντήσεων με υποψήφιους φοιτητές Μηχανικής στη Θεσσαλονίκη.

Traditional marketing tactics no longer suffice in the dynamic world of blockchain, DeFi, and NFTs. As competition grows fiercer, crypto projects need innovative, data-driven approaches to stand out, build trust, and drive adoption.\n\nFrom leveraging AI-powered content creation to tapping into the power of community-driven engagement, success in crypto marketing hinges on a deep understanding of what resonates with investors, users, and enthusiasts. Regulatory landscapes are also evolving, meaning that compliance and transparency are more crucial than ever for credibility.\n\nIn this article, we’ll break down the Top 10 Crypto Marketing Strategies that will define success in 2025. Whether you're launching a new token, scaling a blockchain startup, or building an NFT ecosystem, these tactics will ensure maximum visibility, engagement, and growth. Get ready to explore the latest trends from influencer partnerships and SEO optimization to gamification and Web3-native advertising that will help your crypto brand dominate in the coming year.\n\nWhat is Crypto Marketing?\n\nCrypto marketing is the specialized approach to promoting blockchain-based projects, cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and Web3 platforms. Unlike traditional marketing, it focuses on decentralized ecosystems, token economies, and digital communities, requiring unique strategies to engage investors, users, and developers.\n\nAdditionally, regulatory compliance and credibility play a crucial role in crypto marketing. Unlike conventional brands, blockchain projects must navigate global regulations, ensure ethical promotions, and maintain transparency to build long-term trust. The rise of AI, Web3-native advertising, and decentralized platforms is also reshaping how crypto marketing operates, making data-driven, interactive, and community-centric approaches essential. In 2025 and beyond, successful crypto marketing will rely on a combination of education, gamification, and engagement strategies to onboard new users and drive mainstream adoption.\n\nTop 10 Crypto Marketing Strategies That Guarantee Success in 2025\n\nDiscover the top 10 crypto marketing strategies that will dominate 2025! From influencer partnerships and AI-driven campaigns to community building and token airdrops, these proven tactics will help you boost visibility, attract investors, and drive adoption. Stay ahead of the competition with cutting-edge Web3 marketing techniques that guarantee success in the ever-evolving blockchain space. Whether you're launching a new token or scaling your crypto project, these strategies are game-changers!\n\n1. AI-Powered Marketing &amp; Personalization\n\nAI-driven marketing is revolutionizing the crypto space, allowing projects to target and engage audiences more effectively. In 2025, AI-powered tools will play a crucial role in analyzing market trends, automating customer interactions, and delivering personalized experiences that boost conversions.\n\nOne key advantage of AI in crypto marketing is predictive analytics. By analyzing user behavior, AI can segment audiences and predict which investors or traders are most likely to engage with a project. This allows for highly targeted campaigns, ensuring that promotional efforts reach the right audience at the right time.\n\nChatbots and AI-driven automation are also transforming community engagement. Crypto projects often have global audiences, making 24/7 support essential. AI-powered bots on Telegram, Discord, and websites can provide instant responses, guide new users, and drive engagement while reducing operational costs.\n\nMoreover, AI enhances content personalization. By studying user preferences, AI can recommend relevant articles, tweets, or videos, increasing retention rates. Personalized email marketing and AI-powered copywriting tools further improve engagement by delivering tailored messages that resonate with specific audience segments.\n\nAdditionally, AI assists in fraud detection and compliance, ensuring that marketing campaigns remain compliant with regulations while detecting suspicious activity.\n\nFor crypto projects aiming for long-term success, integrating AI into their marketing strategy is no longer optional it’s a necessity. Whether through automated content creation, AI-driven ad campaigns, or enhanced customer experiences, leveraging AI will be a game-changer in 2025’s competitive crypto landscape.\n\n2. Community-Driven Growth\n\nIn 2025, the success of crypto projects will be increasingly tied to the strength of their communities. Unlike traditional marketing, which relies heavily on advertisements, crypto marketing thrives on organic, community-driven engagement. A strong, engaged community can amplify brand awareness, drive adoption, and foster long-term loyalty.\n\nPlatforms like Telegram, Discord, and Twitter (X) are essential for building active communities. These channels enable direct interaction between project teams and users, allowing for real-time updates, discussions, and feedback. A well-managed community fosters trust, which is critical in the often-volatile crypto market.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to grow a community is through incentivization. Gamified engagement, reward programs, and exclusive perks for early adopters encourage users to actively participate. Token-gated communities, where members gain access to exclusive benefits based on their holdings, are becoming increasingly popular in Web3.\n\nCommunity members can also act as brand advocates, spreading awareness through word-of-mouth marketing. Ambassador programs, where dedicated users promote the project in exchange for rewards, have proven to be highly effective. In addition, regular AMAs (Ask Me Anything) sessions, town halls, and interactive events help maintain engagement and excitement.\n\nHowever, building a community is not just about numbers; it's about quality engagement. Projects that focus on meaningful interactions, transparency, and value-driven content will thrive. In 2025, community-driven marketing will be the backbone of successful crypto projects, ensuring long-term sustainability and organic growth.\n\n3. Influencer &amp; KOL Collaborations\n\nInfluencer and Key Opinion Leader (KOL) marketing has become one of the most powerful tools for crypto projects. In 2025, leveraging trusted voices in the blockchain space will be essential for driving awareness, credibility, and adoption.\n\nCrypto influencers have built strong followings on platforms like YouTube, Twitter (X), and TikTok. Their deep understanding of the market and ability to simplify complex concepts make them ideal for promoting blockchain projects, token launches, and DeFi platforms. Partnering with the right influencers ensures that marketing efforts reach a highly engaged and relevant audience.\n\nHowever, not all influencers bring the same value. Micro-influencers (with 10K–50K followers) often have higher engagement rates than larger influencers, as their audiences tend to be more niche-focused and loyal. A combination of macro and micro KOLs can create a well-rounded influencer strategy.\n\nTransparency is key when working with influencers. Crypto audiences value authenticity, so collaborations should focus on education rather than overly promotional content. Sponsored posts, project reviews, live Q&amp;A sessions, and in-depth analysis videos work best for engaging audiences.\n\nAdditionally, KOL partnerships can extend beyond social media. Influencers can be invited as guest speakers for AMAs, Twitter Spaces, and panel discussions at blockchain events, adding credibility to the project.\n\nIn 2025, influencer marketing will continue to evolve. AI-driven influencer analytics and performance-based compensation models will help crypto projects maximize ROI, ensuring that collaborations lead to tangible user growth and engagement.\n\n4. Token Airdrops &amp; Incentivized Campaigns\n\nToken airdrops remain one of the most effective ways to generate awareness and attract new users in the crypto space. By distributing free tokens to targeted users, projects can drive mass adoption and engagement while incentivizing participation. In 2025, successful crypto projects will refine their airdrop strategies to maximize impact.\n\nAirdrops serve multiple purposes: they introduce users to a new token, encourage trading activity, and help decentralize token distribution. However, poorly executed airdrops can attract opportunistic users who sell immediately rather than engage with the project long-term. To combat this, projects are implementing more strategic airdrop models, such as task-based airdrops.\n\nTask-based airdrops require users to complete specific actions such as following the project on social media, joining a community, or staking tokens to qualify for rewards. This ensures engagement rather than passive participation. Retroactive airdrops, where early supporters and active users are rewarded, also drive long-term loyalty.\n\nAdditionally, referral programs complement airdrops by encouraging users to invite others. Projects can create multi-tiered referral incentives, rewarding users not just for direct referrals but also for their network’s engagement.\n\nWith increasing regulatory scrutiny, transparency is crucial. Projects should ensure compliance by avoiding misleading promotions and providing clear terms for participation.\n\nAs competition in the crypto space intensifies, airdrops and incentivized campaigns will remain essential for onboarding new users. The key to success in 2025 will be executing these campaigns in a way that fosters real engagement and long-term project growth.\n\n5. Content Marketing &amp; Thought Leadership\n\nContent marketing is a cornerstone of successful crypto projects, and in 2025, it will be more important than ever. With increasing competition and regulatory scrutiny, projects must establish credibility and trust through valuable, well-researched content.\n\nHigh-quality blog posts, whitepapers, and educational resources help projects position themselves as industry leaders. Platforms like Medium, Substack, and LinkedIn are ideal for publishing long-form content that explains project fundamentals, market trends, and technological innovations. A well-maintained blog not only informs but also improves search engine rankings, driving organic traffic.\n\nSocial media platforms like Twitter (X) and Reddit play a key role in real-time content distribution. Crypto enthusiasts rely on Twitter threads, market insights, and meme-based content to stay informed. Engaging in industry discussions, participating in trending hashtags, and posting informative threads can significantly boost visibility.\n\nVideo content is also a game-changer. YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram Reels are powerful tools for breaking down complex blockchain concepts into digestible formats. Live streams, explainer videos, and interviews with industry experts can enhance engagement and build trust with audiences.\n\nHosting AMAs, podcasts, and panel discussions further establishes thought leadership. Featuring experts from the crypto space and answering community questions in real time builds credibility and fosters deeper connections with the audience.\n\nUltimately, content marketing in 2025 will be about quality over quantity. Crypto projects that focus on delivering insightful, educational, and engaging content will stand out in an increasingly crowded market.\n\n6. SEO &amp; Search-Optimized Content\n\nWith millions of crypto-related searches happening daily, SEO is a crucial marketing strategy for crypto projects in 2025. As blockchain adoption grows, projects that rank higher on search engines like Google and Web3-native search platforms will gain an edge in visibility and organic traffic.\n\nCrypto SEO involves optimizing content for both traditional and decentralized search engines. This starts with keyword research targeting high-intent phrases like \"best crypto projects 2025\" or \"how to stake tokens.\" Long-tail keywords and question-based searches are particularly effective, as users often look for detailed insights.\n\nOn-page SEO tactics, such as optimizing meta descriptions, using header tags effectively, and ensuring mobile-friendly website design, improve search rankings. Additionally, creating valuable, long-form content like in-depth guides, whitepapers, and educational blogs enhances domain authority.\n\nBacklink strategies are equally important. Securing mentions from authoritative crypto sites like CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, and Decrypt boosts credibility. Collaborating with Web3 influencers, guest posting, and listing projects on crypto directories can significantly improve off-page SEO.\n\nAnother emerging trend is Web3-native SEO, where decentralized search engines index content on blockchain networks. Optimizing for Web3 browsers and using blockchain-based domain names (e.g., .eth or .crypto) will be essential in 2025.\n\nBy combining traditional SEO practices with innovative Web3 strategies, crypto projects can drive sustainable organic traffic, improve visibility, and stay ahead in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.\n\n7. Paid Advertising &amp; Performance Marketing\n\nDespite strict advertising regulations in the crypto space, paid advertising remains a powerful strategy for rapid growth. In 2025, crypto projects must navigate ad restrictions while leveraging performance marketing to drive conversions.\n\nGoogle, Facebook, and Twitter (X) have imposed limitations on crypto-related ads, making it crucial to use compliant ad strategies. Native ad platforms like Coinzilla, Bitmedia, and CoinTraffic offer specialized crypto advertising solutions, ensuring that projects reach targeted Web3 audiences.\n\nPerformance marketing, which focuses on measurable outcomes like conversions, sign-ups, and token purchases, will dominate paid campaigns. Strategies such as PPC (pay-per-click) campaigns, retargeting ads, and programmatic advertising help optimize ad spend while maximizing ROI.\n\nSocial media platforms like YouTube and TikTok also provide effective paid promotion opportunities. Running sponsored content with crypto influencers or launching paid video ads can enhance engagement.\n\nAdditionally, geo-targeting is essential. Certain regions, such as Asia and Latin America, have high crypto adoption rates, making localized ad campaigns a smart move. AI-driven ad optimization tools can further refine targeting, ensuring ads reach users most likely to engage.\n\nAs competition increases, compliance and transparency will be crucial. Crypto projects must ensure their ads adhere to platform policies and focus on educational messaging rather than misleading hype.\n\nBy combining strategic paid advertising with organic marketing efforts, projects can accelerate growth while maintaining credibility in 2025’s evolving regulatory landscape.\n\n8. Strategic Partnerships &amp; Ecosystem Collaborations\n\nStrategic partnerships are a key driver of success in the crypto space, enabling projects to expand their reach, enhance credibility, and tap into new user bases. In 2025, ecosystem collaborations will be more critical than ever, as interoperability and cross-chain integrations become mainstream.\n\nPartnering with established blockchain projects, DeFi platforms, NFT ecosystems, and DAOs can significantly boost a project’s visibility. For example, integrating with Layer 2 scaling solutions or forming alliances with liquidity providers can add tangible value to a crypto project.\n\nCross-promotions between projects also help attract shared audiences. A partnership between a gaming token and an NFT marketplace, for instance, creates synergies that benefit both ecosystems. Similarly, co-hosting events, AMAs, and hackathons can drive engagement and attract new developers.\n\nCrypto projects should also seek collaborations with launchpads and exchanges. Getting listed on reputable platforms like Binance, KuCoin, or OKX enhances credibility and provides immediate exposure to millions of crypto traders. Additionally, joining blockchain alliances and industry consortiums establishes legitimacy and fosters long-term growth.\n\nBy focusing on strategic partnerships rather than one-off collaborations, crypto projects can create sustainable ecosystems that support mutual growth. In 2025, success will depend not just on a project's standalone value but on how well it integrates within the broader blockchain landscape.\n\n9. PR &amp; Media Outreach\n\nPublic relations (PR) and media outreach are essential for building credibility in the crypto space. With increasing scrutiny and competition, projects that secure coverage on top crypto news platforms will gain a significant advantage in 2025.\n\nThe key to effective PR is storytelling. Crypto projects must craft compelling narratives that highlight innovation, use cases, and long-term vision. Simply announcing a token launch is no longer enough for media outlets to prioritize projects that offer real-world solutions and industry advancements.\n\nPress releases distributed through major crypto PR services like Chainwire, CoinTelegraph, and BusinessWire help projects gain exposure. However, direct media outreach is equally important. Building relationships with journalists and crypto bloggers can lead to organic coverage, interviews, and guest features.\n\nPodcasts and YouTube interviews with influential figures in the space also provide valuable PR opportunities. Shows like \"Bankless,\" \"Unchained,\" and \"The Defiant\" have massive audiences interested in emerging blockchain trends.\n\nSocial media-driven PR is another powerful tool. Viral Twitter threads, LinkedIn articles, and community-driven discussions can amplify a project’s message without relying solely on traditional media.\n\nIn 2025, PR strategies must be proactive rather than reactive. Ongoing engagement with media, thought leadership articles, and regular project updates will ensure that a crypto brand stays relevant in an ever-changing market.\n\n10. Gamification &amp; Interactive Engagement\n\nGamification is becoming a dominant trend in crypto marketing, driving user engagement through interactive and reward-based experiences. In 2025, crypto projects that integrate gamified elements will see increased adoption, retention, and community participation.\n\nOne of the most effective gamification strategies is play-to-earn (P2E) and engage-to-earn (E2E) mechanics. By allowing users to earn tokens, NFTs, or staking rewards through participation, projects can boost activity and create loyal communities.\n\nQuests, leaderboard competitions, and interactive challenges also enhance engagement. Crypto projects can use task-based reward systems where users complete actions like staking tokens, referring friends, or engaging in social media discussions to earn incentives.\n\nNFT-based engagement is another emerging trend. Exclusive NFT rewards, gated communities, and tokenized loyalty programs encourage long-term participation. Gamified staking mechanisms, where users earn additional perks based on how long they hold or stake tokens, add another layer of user retention.\n\nSocial media engagement games, like Twitter (X) challenges, Discord scavenger hunts, and interactive quizzes, help projects go viral. Additionally, AI-driven gamification can personalize experiences, tailoring rewards based on user activity.\n\nFor crypto projects looking to stand out in 2025, gamification isn’t just a marketing tactic it’s a strategy for building lasting communities and driving meaningful engagement.\n\nConclusion\n\nSuccess in crypto marketing isn’t about following a single formula, it's about adapting, innovating, and staying ahead of industry shifts. The strategies outlined in this article provide a roadmap to navigate the competitive landscape of 2025, ensuring your project gains the traction it deserves.\n\nBy focusing on community building, AI-powered automation, influencer collaborations, SEO, and data-driven decision-making, crypto projects can achieve sustainable growth and long-term credibility. The key takeaway? Authenticity and engagement matter more than ever. Users and investors are drawn to projects that offer real value, transparency, and interactive experiences rather than empty hype.\n\nAs Web3 technologies continue to evolve, so must your marketing approach. Embrace decentralized social media, gamification, and immersive marketing experiences to stand out in a crowded space. The crypto market may be volatile, but with the right strategies in place, your project can thrive regardless of market fluctuations.\n\nLike\n\nLike\n\nCelebrate\n\nSupport\n\nLove\n\nInsightful\n\nFunny\n\nComment\n\nCopy\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShare\n\n5\n\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n\nMore articles by Stafeeka R\n\nTop 10 Web3 Marketing Companies Setting the Standard in 2025\n\nJul 9, 2025\n\nTop 10 Web3 Marketing Companies Setting the Standard in 2025\n\nWeb3 marketing has evolved into a cornerstone of success for blockchain, crypto, and decentralized projects.

Review on SUI in  2025\n\nJoin the Most Active Community of Traders Today !\n\nWhat is SUI ?\n\nSUI is the native token of the blockchain of the same name. The crypto positions itself as a layer 1 comparable to Ethereum, enabling the development of decentralized applications (dApps). In a highly competitive sector, SUI distinguishes itself through advanced technical characteristics that allow it to compete with other “Ethereum killers” like Solana, Cardano or Avalanche.\n\nThe SUI blockchain was designed to address the fundamental challenges of the blockchain trilemma: scalability, decentralization, and security. Its uniqueness lies in its innovative architecture that provides exceptional performance, particularly in terms of transaction speed and processing capacity.\n\nThe History of SUI\n\nThe project’s history is closely tied to that of the social media giant Meta (formerly Facebook). The SUI token was officially launched on May 2, 2023, by Mysten Labs, a company founded by former Meta developers.\n\nThis connection with Meta is not coincidental. In 2019, the group led by Mark Zuckerberg attempted to launch its own cryptocurrency called Libra. After several twists and a name change to Diem, the project was eventually abandoned. That’s when part of the team decided to continue the blockchain adventure by creating Mysten Labs and developing the blockchain.\n\nThe project quickly attracted interest from top-tier investors. Among SUI’s partners and supporters are major players in the crypto ecosystem such as Circle (issuer of USDC) and Binance Labs, the investment arm of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.\n\nIn 2024, the token reached a decisive milestone with the deployment of Mysticeti, a major improvement to its consensus that significantly enhanced its performance. This update propelled SUI among the fastest blockchains in the world, capable of executing transactions in less than a second.\n\nWho Created SUI ?\n\nMysten Labs, the company behind this project, was founded by a team of blockchain and cryptography experts. The main founders are former Meta developers.\n\nAmong the key figures at Mysten Labs is Adeniyi Abiodun, co-founder of the company, who formulated an ambitious vision for this protocol: “SUI is not just a blockchain; it’s a global coordination layer for the Internet.”\n\nThe Mysten Labs team benefits from solid expertise in blockchain technology development and distributed systems. This experience has allowed them to design a unique architecture that addresses the limitations of existing blockchains.\n\nThe SUI Foundation, meanwhile, plays a crucial role in developing the ecosystem. It actively supports developers and projects building on the blockchain, while promoting the adoption of the technology globally.\n\nDiscover SUI on Bitget – Buy easily and quickly !\n\nWhat is SUI Crypto Used For ?\n\nThe token fulfills several essential functions within the SUI blockchain ecosystem :\n\nFirst, SUI serves as a means of payment for transaction fees on the network. Each operation performed on the SUI blockchain requires the payment of fees in SUI tokens, which creates a constant demand for the cryptocurrency.\n\nSecond, it’s a governance token that allows its holders to participate in decisions regarding the evolution of the protocol. Token holders can vote on improvement proposals and thus influence the future direction of the project.\n\nThird, the token can be used for staking, a process that involves locking up tokens to secure the network and receive rewards in return. Staking SUI offers investors a source of passive income while contributing to the security and decentralization of the network.\n\nFinally, it facilitates the development of decentralized applications (dApps) in various domains such as decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, blockchain games, and many others. The SUI blockchain is particularly suited for applications requiring high processing speed and low latency.\n\nBy 2025, the SUI ecosystem has significantly expanded with numerous protocols contributing to its growth. Among them are DeepBook (liquidity infrastructure), Walrus (decentralized storage solution), as well as DeFi projects like Bluefin, Suilend, Cetus, Scallop, and Momentum.\n\nHow Does the SUI Network Work ?\n\nThe blockchain specific to the project distinguishes itself through its innovative architecture that provides exceptional performance. Unlike many traditional blockchains, it uses an approach that allows for horizontal scalability, meaning the ability to increase performance simply by adding more resources.\n\nThe Architecture of the SUI Blockchain\n\nOne of the main innovations of SUI lies in its ability to process transactions in parallel. While many blockchains process transactions sequentially, SUI can execute independent transactions simultaneously, which significantly increases its throughput.\n\nTo achieve this remarkable performance, SUI relies on two innovative systems :\n\nThe Narwhal mempool protocol based on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph): this system efficiently organizes transactions before validation.\n\nThe Tusk consensus algorithm: this algorithm ensures transaction finality while maintaining a high level of security and decentralization.\n\nThanks to this unique architecture, SUI can theoretically achieve scalability exceeding 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). By comparison, Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain for decentralized applications, caps at around 15 TPS.\n\nIn  2025, the deployment of Mysticeti further improved these performances, making SUI one of the fastest blockchains in the world. This update enabled executing transactions and swaps in less than a second, offering a user experience close to that of traditional financial systems.\n\nThe Move Programming Language\n\nSUI uses a programming language called Move for smart contract development. This language, initially developed for Meta’s Libra/Diem project, offers several significant advantages:\n\nMove is an open-source language specially designed for blockchain applications. It emphasizes code security and verifiability, two crucial aspects in developing decentralized applications.\n\nOne of Move’s distinctive characteristics is its resistance to “reentrancy” attacks, which have affected other blockchains like Ethereum. This resistance is ensured by a rigorous system and formal verification mechanisms.\n\nThe combination of these characteristics makes SUI a platform particularly suited for developing decentralized financial applications requiring a high level of security.\n\nBuy SUI at low fees on Bitget now !\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of SUI\n\nLike any blockchain technology, this protocol has advantages and disadvantages that should be analyzed to understand its potential and limitations.\n\nThe Advantages\n\nExceptional scalability : With a theoretical capacity exceeding 100,000 TPS, SUI positions itself among the most performant blockchains in the market. This scalability allows it to support a large number of users and applications without compromising performance.\n\nLow latency : Thanks to its parallel architecture and the Mysticeti improvement, it offers extremely fast transaction confirmation times, often less than a second. This characteristic is particularly appreciated for applications requiring immediate responsiveness, such as games or trading platforms.\n\nEnhanced security : The Move programming language, used for development on SUI, offers security guarantees superior to those of many other smart contract languages. Its resistance to reentrancy attacks and its technical approach significantly reduce the risks of bugs and vulnerabilities.\n\nGrowing ecosystem : By 2025, the SUI ecosystem has significantly expanded with numerous protocols and applications in various domains. This diversity creates a dynamic environment conducive to innovation and adoption.\n\nInstitutional support : The crypto benefits from the support of renowned investors and partners, which strengthens its credibility and long-term growth potential. The growing interest of traditional financial institutions in SUI demonstrates its maturity and potential.\n\nThe Disadvantages\n\nFierce competition : SUI operates in a highly competitive sector, where numerous blockchains compete for the position of alternative to Ethereum. This competition could limit its growth and long-term adoption.\n\nRelative youth : Launched in 2023, SUI is still a relatively young blockchain compared to established projects like Ethereum or Bitcoin. This youth implies a less mature ecosystem and potentially more risks for developers and users.\n\nPotential centralization : Like many new-generation blockchains prioritizing performance, SUI could face criticism regarding its level of decentralization. The compromise between performance and decentralization is a constant challenge in the blockchain industry.\n\nLimited adoption : Despite its rapid recent growth, the adoption of SUI remains limited compared to leading market blockchains. Increasing its adoption will depend on its ability to attract more developers and users.\n\nPrice volatility : Like all cryptocurrencies, the SUI token is subject to high volatility, which can constitute a risk for investors and limit its use as a stable means of payment.\n\nSUI Price and Predictions\n\nThe journey of the SUI token since its launch has been marked by significant fluctuations, reflecting both the project’s potential and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.\n\nHistorical Price Evolution\n\nAt its launch in May 2023, the SUI token was trading around $1.30. After a month of relative stability, the price entered a downward phase, reaching its all-time low on October 19, 2023, at $0.36.\n\nHowever, since this low point, the trend has reversed and the token has experienced remarkable progress. As of mid-May 2025, the SUI price is around $3.49, representing a 10-fold increase from its all-time low. Its all-time high is at $5.35.\n\nThis progression is explained by several factors, notably the successful deployment of Mysticeti in 2024, the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem on SUI, and the growing interest of institutional investors in the project.\n\nIn  2025, the market capitalization of the crypto now exceeds $12 billion, placing the cryptocurrency in the global top 15, testifying to its rapid progression in the cryptocurrency ranking.\n\nPrice Predictions for 2025, 2030, and 2050\n\nAnalysts are generally optimistic about the future price of SUI, although their forecasts vary considerably.\n\nAccording to Coinedition, the crypto’s price could reach $5.35 by the end of 2025, then $14.84 in 2030 and potentially $48.65 in 2050. These long-term projections reflect confidence in the project’s viability and continued growth.\n\nMore recently, according to a Tronweekly article published in May 2025, the crypto could potentially reach $8.31 by the end of 2025, driven by a bullish technical dynamic and a significant increase in trading volumes.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that these predictions should be taken with a grain of salt. They are by no means in-depth analyses, and we always encourage you to do your own research. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile and unpredictable, and many external factors can influence the evolution of the SUI price.\n\nKey Moments in the History of SUI\n\nSince its launch, the SUI blockchain has experienced several key moments that have shaped its development and adoption.\n\nMay 2023 : Official launch of the SUI token by Mysten Labs. The project quickly attracts attention thanks to its experienced team from Meta and its promising technology.\n\nOctober 2023 : The crypto price reaches its all-time low at $0.36, marking the end of an initial correction phase.\n\nEarly 2024 : Deployment of Mysticeti, a major consensus improvement that transforms SUI into one of the fastest blockchains in the world. This update allows for executing transactions in less than a second.\n\nAugust 2024 : Launch of the Grayscale SUI Trust, an institutional investment product dedicated to SUI, testifying to the growing interest of traditional investors in this cryptocurrency.\n\nNovember 2024 : Franklin Templeton Digital Assets, the crypto branch of the famous American asset manager handling over $1.5 trillion, announces a strategic partnership with the SUI Foundation.\n\nEarly 2025 : Canary Capital files an application for an ETF based on SUI, including a yield option via token staking. This initiative is followed by 21Shares, one of the main crypto ETP issuers in the world.\n\nJanuary 2025 : SUI reaches its all-time high at $5.35 after a 32% increase in 3 days.\n\nApril 2025 : SUI crosses the milestone of 500 million processed transactions, far exceeding other major blockchains like Ethereum (129 million) over the same period.\n\nMay 2025 : The TVL (Total Value Locked) on SUI exceeds $4 billion, including more than $900 million in stablecoins, confirming the rise of its DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThese milestones illustrate the rapid progression of the crypto and its ability to attract developers, users, and institutional investors alike.\n\nHow and Where to Buy SUI ?\n\nAcquiring SUI tokens is an essential step for those who wish to invest in the project, participate in its governance, or use the applications in its ecosystem. Due to its growing market capitalization and popularity, the SUI token is available on the majority of centralized exchange platforms (CEX).\n\nThese platforms allow you to buy SUI directly with euros or dollars via different payment methods (bank card, wire transfer).

For direct ownership and total control of your assets, we recommend a specialized exchange platform.\n\nHow to Buy SUI on Bitget? Mini Tutorial\n\nHere’s how to buy the crypto in 5 steps on the best platform in our ranking.\n\nCreate an account on Bitget :\n\nGo to the official website\n\nClick on “Sign Up”\n\nFill out the form with your email and password\n\nComplete the KYC :\n\nPrepare a valid ID document\n\nFollow the verification instructions\n\nDeposit funds :\n\nFund your account on the platform. Via bank transfer, credit card, or other cryptocurrencies for example.\n\nBuy SUI :\n\nNavigate to “Spot Trading”\n\nSearch for the SUI/USDT or SUI/EUR pair\n\nPlace a buy order by specifying the quantity of crypto you want to acquire or the amount you want to spend.\n\nYou can generally choose between a market order (purchase at the current price) or a limit order (purchase at a specific price you define).\n\nSecure your SUI tokens :\n\nAfter purchase, it is strongly recommended to transfer your tokens from the exchange platform to a secure personal wallet (see next section) to have total control over them.\n\nChoose a platform that matches your needs in terms of fees, security, ease of use, and regulatory compliance in your jurisdiction.\n\nBuy SUI with ease on Bitget !\n\nHow to Store SUI ?\n\nOnce you have acquired tokens, the question of their secure storage becomes paramount. Leaving your cryptocurrencies on an exchange platform (CEX) involves significant risks: you don’t directly control your private keys, and your funds could be lost in case of platform hacking, regulatory issues, or company bankruptcy.\n\nThis is why it is strongly recommended to transfer your SUI to a personal wallet for which you alone hold the private keys. “Not your keys, not your coins“.\n\nThere are mainly two types of wallets for storing your SUI:\n\nCold Wallets : These are hardware devices that store your private keys offline, thus offering the highest level of security against online hacking. They often resemble secure USB keys. Recognized brands like Ledger (for example, Ledger Nano S Plus or Ledger Nano X) are the safest solutions for storing significant amounts or for long-term storage.\n\nHot Wallets : These are software (mobile or desktop applications, browser extensions) that store your private keys on a device connected to the Internet. They are more convenient for frequent use and for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps), but are inherently more vulnerable to malware and phishing than cold wallets. Popular wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet can be configured to manage SUI tokens.\n\nThe choice between a cold wallet and a hot wallet depends on your specific needs: prioritize a cold wallet (like Ledger) for maximum security of your main investments, and possibly use a hot wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet) for smaller amounts intended for regular interactions with the SUI DeFi ecosystem. The essential thing is to always carefully secure your recovery phrase (seed phrase) and never share it or store it digitally.\n\nYour SUI, secure on Ledger !\n\nHow to Get SUI for Free ?\n\nObtaining tokens for free is possible through several methods, although the amounts are generally limited.\n\n“Faucets” are websites that distribute small amounts of cryptocurrencies for free. Several faucets dedicated to SUI exist, allowing users to receive a small quantity of tokens in exchange for completing simple tasks like solving captchas or viewing advertisements.\n\nThe SUI Foundation and projects built on the SUI blockchain regularly organize reward programs and airdrops to promote adoption of the ecosystem. These initiatives can take several forms, such as testnet programs, project airdrops, referral programs, or Learn-to-Earn campaigns.\n\nAlthough staking is not strictly speaking a method to obtain the crypto for free (since it requires already owning tokens), it nevertheless constitutes a way to increase your position in SUI without additional investment. In  2025, staking SUI offers an average annual yield of about 3 to 5%, depending on market conditions and the chosen validator.\n\nIt’s important to note that these methods generally do not allow obtaining significant quantities of SUI and should not be considered as an alternative to traditional investment if you wish to take a significant position.\n\nIs SUI Legal ?\n\nThe legality of the crypto varies considerably depending on jurisdictions, as with all cryptocurrencies. In the European Union, the crypto is legal and regulated by the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation that came into force in  2025, which provides a harmonized regulatory framework for crypto-assets across all member countries.\n\nIn the United States, SUI is generally considered legal, with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) not having classified it as a “security”. This recognition allows SUI to be traded on major American platforms like Coinbase, and the growing interest of American financial institutions testifies to its integration into the regulatory framework.\n\nIn Asia, the situation is more contrasted: the crypto is legal in Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, but banned in China where all cryptocurrency transactions have been prohibited since 2021. In most developed countries, the crypto is legal, although often subject to specific tax obligations.\n\nTaxation Related to Capital Gains\n\nTax implications also vary by country. In France, capital gains realized when selling SUI are subject to the 30% “flat tax”, while in the United States, SUI is considered property by the IRS, with variable tax rates depending on the holding period. It is strongly recommended to consult a tax advisor familiar with cryptocurrencies to precisely understand your obligations in your jurisdiction.\n\nWho Holds the Most SUI ?\n\nMysten Labs, as the creator of the blockchain, holds a significant share of the tokens, estimated at about 10% of the total supply. This allocation helps fund the continuous development of the technology and ecosystem, thus ensuring the project’s long-term sustainability.\n\nThe SUI Foundation, a non-profit organization responsible for promoting and developing the ecosystem, also owns about 5% of the total supply. These tokens are primarily intended to fund developer grants, community initiatives, and global adoption programs.\n\nSeveral venture capital funds and companies have invested in the crypto during private funding rounds, including Binance Labs, Circle Ventures, a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), and Jump Crypto. Their participation testifies to institutional investors’ confidence in the long-term potential of the crypto.\n\nWith the development of investment products like the Grayscale SUI Trust and potential ETFs under evaluation, a growing share of tokens is now held by these investment vehicles, facilitating traditional investors’ access to this asset class. This evolution contributes to a wider distribution of tokens and a progressive decentralization of the network.\n\nReview on SUI in  2025\n\nIn  2025, the crypto has established itself as one of the most innovative blockchain projects in the crypto market. Its cutting-edge technology, combining a unique parallel architecture and the Move programming language, gives it a significant competitive advantage in terms of performance and security.\n\nThe ecosystem that has developed around the crypto is particularly dynamic, with a TVL exceeding $4 billion and applications in various domains such as DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain games. This diversity testifies to the platform’s versatility and its ability to attract talented developers, a key success factor in the blockchain industry.\n\nThe growing interest of traditional financial institutions in SUI, illustrated by ETF applications and strategic partnerships with leading asset managers, also constitutes a strong signal of the project’s maturity and credibility. This institutional recognition, combined with exceptional technical performance, positions SUI as an essential player in Web3 for years to come. Our opinion is therefore globally positive.\n\nSUI at your fingertips on Bitget!\n\nKevin\n\nAvec une formation en ingénierie mécanique et en gestion de projets, j'ai travaillé dans l'industrie automobile et nucléaire pendant 10 ans. Reconverti dans la rédaction web il y a quelques années, j'utilise mes connaissances techniques pour écrire des articles sur des sujets spécifiques liés aux finances, aux cryptomonnaies, à la blockchain et aux Fintech.\n\nFAQ on SUI\n\nWhat sets SUI apart from other Layer 1 blockchains ?\n\nSUI stands out thanks to its parallel architecture that enables simultaneous processing of independent transactions, its security-focused Move programming language, and its exceptional scalability capable of exceeding 100,000 TPS.\n\nIs SUI a good investment in 2025 ?\n\nWhile SUI shows promising potential with its advanced technology and growing adoption, all cryptocurrency investments carry risks. It is advisable to diversify your portfolio and only invest what you are prepared to lose.\n\nHow can you participate in SUI governance ?\n\nSUI token holders can engage in governance by staking their tokens and voting on protocol improvement proposals through the blockchain’s decentralized governance system.\n\nCan SUI surpass Ethereum in the long term ?\n\nAlthough SUI offers significant technical advantages in scalability and cost efficiency, Ethereum benefits from a mature ecosystem and widespread adoption. The most likely scenario is the coexistence of both blockchains, each leveraging its unique strengths.\n\nWhat are the most promising applications on SUI in 2025 ?\n\nDeFi applications like DeepBook, Cetus, and Scallop, along with decentralized storage solutions such as Walrus, rank among the most promising projects in the SUI ecosystem for 2025.\n\nAbonnez-vous et recevez le r&eacute;sum&eacute; de l&rsquo;actualit&eacute; Crypto chaque semaine !\n\n-->\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as investment advice.

The global crypto market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion for the first time since late 2021 binance.com, more than doubling from the bear-market lows. In fact, total crypto market cap hit around $3.4 trillion at its peak in June tradealgo.com marketpulse.com before a mild pullback. Despite these lofty valuations, market sentiment, while optimistic, had not yet reached the euphoria of previous tops – the Crypto Fear &amp; Greed Index hovered in the 70s (greed) in June, down from extreme highs (&gt;90) seen at the 2024 peak coindcx.com. This suggests investors remained “cautiously bullish,” with big targets in mind but also aware of potential risks coindcx.com.\nIn June, Bitcoin traded just a few percent below its record high and showed resilience even during brief market stumbles coindesk.com. For instance, after a 10% dip in early June (from ~$110K down toward $100K), buyers swiftly stepped in to “buy the dip,” liquidating over $300M in short positions in one day coindesk.com. Analysts described the price action as a “peaceful rally” characterized by consistent higher highs and rapid dip-buying coindesk.com. Ethereum similarly notched its first green monthly candle of 2025 in May, jumping 40% that month and adding another ~10% in early June aminagroup.com. By late June, Ether was testing a critical ~$2.8K resistance level that, if broken, could pave the way for a move above $3,000 coindcx.com coindcx.com.\nBroader altcoin markets rallied alongside the blue-chips. Large-cap tokens in decentralized finance (DeFi) like Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (AAVE) spiked ~20% mid-June after encouraging signals from U.S. regulators (discussed later) aminagroup.com. Solana’s price more than doubled since January, supported by rising total value locked (TVL) on its network (which doubled in H1 2025 alone) and technical upgrades boosting investor confidence ainvest.com. Even memecoins and niche sectors saw renewed speculation – a Solana-based memecoin launchpad Pump.fun announced plans to raise $1B via token sale at a $4B valuation amid the hype ccn.com.\nIn summary, by June 2025 the crypto market had staged a remarkable recovery from the prior year, with Bitcoin around $107K (nearly 50% above its previous 2021 peak coindesk.com) and total crypto capitalization back above $3T binance.com. Market breadth improved as well: while Bitcoin led the rally early, mid-2025 saw capital rotating into Ethereum and select altcoins. Historically, the late stages of crypto bull markets see “alts outperform BTC and make new highs”, and indeed analysts noted that the biggest and quickest gains often occur in the final phase of a bull run coindcx.com. Whether the market is entering that euphoric final phase or just a mid-cycle consolidation remains a point of debate as we head into H2 2025.\nMacroeconomic and External Influences on Crypto\nMacroeconomic trends in 2025 have been a key tailwind for crypto. In the U.S., inflation has decelerated faster than expected – the May CPI came in at just +0.1% (vs 0.3% core expected), indicating that price pressures are easing aminagroup.com. This “good inflation news” gave risk assets room to breathe. Equities grinded higher, and Bitcoin jumped on the data release, briefly pushing past $110K on hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon end its rate hikes aminagroup.com. Indeed, by June there was open talk of the Fed pivoting to rate cuts later in 2025 if inflation stays subdued aminagroup.com coindesk.com. Federal Reserve officials are considering rate cuts, and such liquidity easing could benefit cryptocurrencies and stocks alike coindesk.com. The backdrop of potential monetary loosening has strengthened the bullish case for Bitcoin, which many investors view as a hedge in a low real-yield environment.\nGlobal commodity trends have further bolstered the outlook. Oil prices unexpectedly fell in Q2, relieving some inflationary pressure coindesk.com. Lower energy costs reduce the risk of another inflation spike, supporting the case for Fed rate cuts or at least a sustained pause. In markets, the anticipation of an easier Fed has weakened the U.S. dollar from its 2022 highs, another factor historically correlated with crypto strength. A prominent crypto analyst noted that Bitcoin’s price resilience – holding largely above $100K even through geopolitical flare-ups – is itself attracting more buyers, illustrating a reflexive cycle where strength begets strength coindesk.com coindesk.com. In other words, as Bitcoin stayed firm despite events like Middle East tensions or U.S.–China trade spats, investor confidence grew that crypto is maturing as a macro asset class.\nThat said, the macro picture isn’t without risks. Geopolitical events and policy uncertainty still cause short-term volatility. For example, when U.S.–Iran tensions briefly escalated in early June (including an airstrike), Bitcoin saw a “heavy short-term dip” below $100K – but notably rebounded quickly as buyers viewed it as a buying opportunity coindesk.com coindesk.com. Similarly, looming trade negotiations (e.g. U.S.–China talks) and tariff policy decisions have markets on watch aminagroup.com. Crypto observers note that while Bitcoin is increasingly treated as “digital gold”, providing a safe haven during some crises, it is still a risk-sensitive asset influenced by global liquidity and risk appetite tronweekly.com tronweekly.com. Broader policy uncertainties – such as the outcome of U.S. budget debates or global regulatory coordination – “could keep bullish momentum in check,” as one market report cautioned aminagroup.com.\nOn balance, the macroeconomic climate in mid-2025 is favorable for crypto: inflation is down, interest rates are expected to peak (with bond yields stabilizing or falling), and major economies have so far averted recession. Stocks and crypto have been moving in tandem in a risk-on trade – for instance, the S&amp;P 500 was up modestly in June alongside Bitcoin’s rally aminagroup.com. If the Fed and other central banks start easing monetary policy in the coming months, that liquidity boost could further propel crypto markets. CoinDesk analysts highlighted this alignment of factors – policy shifts, commodity relief, and technical momentum – as underpinning forecasts for Bitcoin to potentially reach $120K later this year coindesk.com coindesk.com.\nHowever, investors are also mindful that tightening or shocks could return. Any sign of resurgent inflation or an abrupt change in central bank stance would likely introduce volatility. Additionally, regulatory developments (covered below) form part of the macro narrative: the increasing clarity in regulations has been a positive influence on market sentiment, whereas any adverse government action can rapidly sour the mood. In summary, crypto’s mid-2025 surge has been “waiting for its next macro cue,” with Bitcoin now “at a crossroads” poised between structural support and waning momentum depending on economic signals ahead coindesk.com. All eyes are on the Fed and inflation readings in H2 2025 as potential catalysts for crypto’s next major move.\nMajor Blockchain Technology Updates and Innovations\nBeyond market prices, 2025 has been a year of significant breakthroughs in blockchain technology. In the first half of the year, several long-awaited upgrades and innovations went live across major networks, aiming to improve scalability, security, and usability of crypto platforms.\nEthereum’s “Pectra” Upgrade: Ethereum underwent a major network upgrade codenamed Pectra on May 7, 2025 coinbase.com. This upgrade – Ethereum’s most ambitious since the 2024 “Dencun” fork – combined changes to both the execution layer (“Prague” hard fork) and the consensus layer (“Electra” upgrade) coinbase.com. Pectra implemented 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), more than any previous upgrade coinbase.com, with far-reaching impacts:\nSmart Wallets &amp; Account Abstraction: One headline feature is EIP-7702, which enables a form of account abstraction by allowing externally owned accounts (EOAs – regular wallets) to temporarily execute smart contract code during a transaction coinbase.com. In practical terms, this lets users do things like batched transactions, meta-transactions (gas sponsored by a third party), and custom signature validation – without converting their account to a full contract. This upgrade should vastly improve user experience (no more juggling multiple transactions for a single DeFi action) and brings Ethereum “closer to full account abstraction”, making the network more flexible and user-friendly coinbase.com coinbase.com.\nScalability Boost (“Data Blobs”): Pectra also included EIP-7691 and related changes that increase data throughput for Layer-2 rollups coinbase.com. Building on 2024’s proto-danksharding, the upgrade raises the amount of blob data (batched transaction data) Ethereum can handle, directly benefiting Layer-2 networks that post data to Ethereum. This reduces fees and latency for popular Layer-2 solutions and is a step toward full sharding in the future. As a result, Ethereum’s capacity to support high throughput applications (DeFi, gaming, etc.) has grown, potentially lowering transaction fees and congestion on the main chain coinbase.com.\nStaking &amp; Validator Improvements: Another key change (EIP-7251) raised Ethereum’s max effective staking balance, allowing validators to put more than the previous limit (32 ETH) to work in securing the network coinbase.com coinbase.com. This can improve capital efficiency for large stakers. Additionally, EIP-6110 brings validator deposits on-chain for smoother onboarding, and tweaks like EIP-7549 and EIP-7623 refine consensus processes coinbase.com coinbase.com. The net effect is a more flexible and robust Proof-of-Stake network. Pectra’s changes should reduce validator downtime, lower reorg risks, and make it easier to run nodes – all bolstering Ethereum’s security and decentralization.\nOverall, Ethereum’s upgrade spree has reinforced its role as the leading smart contract platform. The network’s thriving Layer-2 ecosystem also got a boost: protocols like zkSync and StarkNet have continued to expand in 2025, offering faster and cheaper transactions on top of Ethereum coindcx.com. In fact, the Layer-2 daily transaction volume now regularly exceeds Ethereum L1’s as users migrate to rollups for routine activity. The Ethereum Foundation has committed over $30M in new grants this year to improve Layer-2 efficiency and development tools cryptopotato.com. With record-high Ethereum staking (over 28% of ETH supply staked) coindcx.com and even Ethereum futures ETFs attracting interest (BlackRock’s new ETH ETF garnered $4B+ in inflows by June ccn.com ccn.com), the technical and economic state of Ethereum is strong heading into H2.\nSolana’s Performance Upgrades: Outside of Ethereum, other blockchain projects have executed notable innovations. Solana, known for its high throughput, is addressing past reliability issues by overhauling its core software. In 2025, Jump Crypto’s “Firedancer” – an independent Solana validator client – moved into testnet and early deployment, showing impressive results. Firedancer, built in C++ from scratch, aims to massively increase Solana’s throughput and stability. In stress tests, Firedancer achieved 600,000+ transactions per second (TPS), far above Solana’s current ~3,000 TPS in production cryptoeq.io coincodex.com. By mid-2025, Firedancer had begun delegating stake (8–9% of total) to community validators to bootstrap its adoption ainvest.com. Developers expect Firedancer to go live on mainnet by late 2025, a change that could make Solana one of the fastest and most resilient chains in the industry. This is significant given Solana’s challenges in 2022–23; the network experienced outages and lost favor after a major exchange collapse. Now, Solana’s comeback is in full swing, with its TVL doubling in H1 2025 ainvest.com and new infrastructure like Firedancer instilling confidence that Solana can scale without sacrificing uptime.\nBitcoin Layer-2 and Ordinals: On the Bitcoin network, innovation has been more incremental but notable. The Bitcoin Lightning Network – BTC’s primary Layer-2 for fast payments – continued to grow, with capacity reaching new highs (estimated well above 8,000 BTC locked in channels globally). Lightning is seeing increasing adoption for remittances and micro-transactions as firms like Block (formerly Square) and Strike expand Lightning-powered services. Bitcoin’s base layer also experienced a surge of new use cases via the Ordinals protocol, which enables NFTs and fungible tokens on Bitcoin (through “inscriptions” on satoshis). The BRC-20 token standard (emerging in 2023) led to bursts of activity and congestion on Bitcoin early in 2025, as memecoins on Bitcoin became briefly popular. This sparked a debate on Bitcoin’s purpose and block space usage. By June, the frenzy had subsided, but developers are exploring solutions (like scaling Bitcoin’s mempool or dual-layer architectures) to accommodate diverse uses without compromising Bitcoin’s core functionality.\nOther Protocol Innovations: Several other blockchain projects introduced new consensus mechanisms and performance upgrades in 2025:\nCardano implemented its promised improvements from the 2024 Hydra and Input Endorsers research, aiming to increase throughput via off-chain staking pools and parallel processing.\nPolkadot rolled out asynchronous backing for its parachains, improving block times and throughput across its ecosystem.\nCosmos/Tendermint chains are experimenting with optimistic consensus and interchain security to allow smaller chains to piggyback on the security of hub chains.\nA novel proposal called “Beam Chain” was floated in Ethereum research circles, outlining a potential overhaul of Ethereum’s consensus to integrate succinct proofs – though this is early-stage, it signals the continuous R&amp;D into next-generation blockchain designs reddit.com.\nZero-knowledge proofs saw wider deployment beyond Ethereum L2: projects like Mina Protocol and Aztec pushed ahead with privacy-focused zkApps, and even traditional institutions started piloting zk-proofs for confidential transactions (e.g. Swift’s blockchain trials for asset transfers with privacy).\nIn summary, the technological foundation of the crypto industry grew stronger in 2025. Ethereum’s upgrades are tackling the blockchain trilemma by increasing scalability without major sacrifices to decentralization or security coinbase.com coinbase.com, and other chains are similarly advancing. Interoperability is also improving – cross-chain bridges and messaging protocols (like Polkadot’s XCM and Cosmos IBC) are maturing, allowing assets and data to flow between chains more seamlessly than before. All these innovations play a critical role in supporting the next wave of adoption: as more users and institutions come on-chain, the infrastructure is being readied to handle higher volumes and more sophisticated applications (from DeFi and gaming to real-world asset tokenization).\nNotable Partnerships, Acquisitions, and Funding Trends\nInstitutional and corporate activity in crypto hit a fever pitch in June 2025, with major partnerships, acquisitions, and funding rounds signaling a deepening integration of crypto into traditional finance. A series of high-profile deals underscored the theme of “Wall Street meets Crypto”:\nCircle’s Blockbuster IPO: Stablecoin issuer Circle (creator of USDC) went public on the NYSE on June 5, 2025, marking one of the most successful crypto IPOs to date ccn.com. The company raised $1.1 billion in its debut (34 million shares at $31 each) and saw its stock soar 168% on the first trading day aminagroup.com. Within two weeks, Circle’s stock price had jumped 800% to over $270 ccn.com, giving it a market cap eclipsing even the ~$60B circulating value of USDC ccn.com. This eye-popping demand (the IPO was oversubscribed ~25×) highlights mainstream investors’ appetite for exposure to crypto infrastructure companies. Circle’s successful listing – coming after a previously aborted SPAC attempt – validates the public markets’ interest in the crypto sector and paves the way for others.\nExchange M&amp;A – Robinhood &amp; Bitstamp: In an East-meets-West exchange deal, retail brokerage Robinhood acquired Bitstamp, one of Europe’s longest-running crypto exchanges, for $200 million on June 2 aminagroup.com. This strategic acquisition instantly gives Robinhood licenses in 50+ jurisdictions (via Bitstamp’s regulatory approvals) and a base of millions of international crypto users aminagroup.com. Robinhood is positioning to offer crypto trading to both retail and institutional clients globally, leveraging Bitstamp’s infrastructure and compliance footprint. The move also reflects consolidation in the exchange space – larger players are scooping up established exchanges to expand their reach and user base. Around the same time, Gemini (the Winklevoss-owned exchange) confidentially filed for a U.S. IPO (targeting late 2025 or early 2026) ccn.com, and Kraken raised $27M in a pre-IPO funding round at a valuation up to $4B as it eyes a potential 2026 listing ccn.com. Even Bullish, a exchange backed by Peter Thiel, resurfaced plans to go public ccn.com. All told, 2025 is living up to predictions of a “Year of the Crypto IPO,” with multiple crypto unicorns heading for public markets bitwiseinvestments.com.\nFintech-Blockchain Integrations: Payment giants are embracing stablecoins and blockchain tech via partnerships. In June, Fiserv – a Fortune 500 payment processor – launched its own stablecoin FIUSD on the Solana blockchain ccn.com. FIUSD is integrated into Fiserv’s banking/payments network and even partnered with PayPal for interoperability ccn.com, marking one of the first instances of major payment companies directly issuing a crypto asset. Around the same time, Societe Generale, one of France’s largest banks, announced plans to issue a dollar-pegged stablecoin through its digital assets arm – making it the first major bank to create a USD stablecoin for public trading ccn.com. These moves anticipate regulatory approval of stablecoins in key jurisdictions (with new laws in both the US and EU on the horizon) and show traditional finance firms trying to get ahead of the curve by launching their own compliant crypto tokens. Additionally, Stripe (the Silicon Valley payments company) made a crypto play by acquiring wallet provider Privy to help integrate crypto and Web3 functionality into its products aminagroup.com. Stripe’s acquisition underscores that fintechs see blockchain as core to the future of payments and identity.\nTradFi–Crypto Convergence Deals: The convergence of traditional finance and crypto was a defining theme. As an analyst noted, these deals are “not isolated moves, they’re the latest in a multi-year trend” of institutional embrace of crypto aminagroup.com. For example, Circle’s NYSE listing was a “clear sign of institutional appetite for compliant, crypto-native infrastructure” aminagroup.com. Meanwhile, Stripe’s foray into wallets and Robinhood’s global crypto push show Web2 and fintech firms integrating crypto to stay competitive aminagroup.com. Such activity reflects growing regulatory clarity and recognition of crypto’s role in the future of finance aminagroup.com. Another illustrative deal was Nasdaq’s June acquisition of a crypto custody startup (notably anchoring its own crypto custody service launch) – bolstering the trend of major stock exchanges and banks entering the crypto custodial and trading space.\nBlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has been a runaway success, amassing ~$75 billion AUM within 18 months of launch and signaling surging institutional demand for crypto tronweekly.com tronweekly.com. The rise of regulated Bitcoin ETFs is bridging traditional capital markets and the crypto world.\nVenture Capital and Funding Rounds: After a quieter 2022–23, venture funding in crypto has roared back in 2025. June alone saw 23 projects raise $190M+ in one week messari.io, and according to one tally, the month’s total funding reached $4.49 billion across 100+ deals – a 48% jump from May ainvest.com. Several startups achieved unicorn status with nine-figure raises. For instance, Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, closed a $200M funding round at a $1B valuation ccn.com. Its competitor Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated events futures exchange, raised $185M (Series C) at a $2B valuation ccn.com. DeFi and trading platforms are also attracting big money: Gradient, EigenLabs, and others focusing on liquidity and staking each raised tens of millions. Even novel concepts like crypto-powered betting (BetDEX) and AI-driven Web3 projects found significant investor interest, reflecting a broadening of use-case investment beyond just trading apps.\nCrypto Reserve SPAC: In a crossover of crypto and Wall Street, a former Blackstone executive teamed up with Tether’s co-founder to launch a $1 billion SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) aimed at creating a “crypto reserve” vehicle ccn.com. This listed entity, once merged, would hold a portfolio of cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL as reserves. The effort, underway in June, highlights creative new investment products blending public markets with direct crypto exposure. It’s effectively an attempt to list a diversified crypto holding company through a SPAC – demonstrating the ongoing financialization of crypto assets.\nCorporate Treasury and Institutional Flows: Institutions continued to accumulate Bitcoin and crypto as a treasury asset. In June, publicly traded companies collectively bought over 18,000 BTC for their balance sheets ccn.com. MicroStrategy, already the largest corporate BTC holder, added another 10,345 BTC (~$1.1B worth) during the month ccn.com. A Japanese investment firm, Metaplanet, snapped up 4,545 BTC ($485M at $106K avg price) to reach its goal of 10,000 BTC holdings ahead of schedule ccn.com. Even celebrity investors like Anthony Pompliano joined the fray via vehicles like ProCap BTC LLC, which bought 3,724 BTC ($387M) in June ccn.com. These accumulations show strong institutional conviction in crypto’s long-term value, with public companies now owning tens of thousands of BTC. Moreover, regulated crypto investment funds saw sustained inflows: Bitcoin ETF products in the U.S. had an eight-day streak of inflows totaling $2.4B in mid-June ccn.com. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) – launched in late 2023 after the SEC’s landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs – has become the fastest-growing ETF ever, reaching ~$75B AUM in 18 months and generating $186M in annual fees (surpassing even BlackRock’s S&amp;P 500 ETF by revenue) tronweekly.com tronweekly.com. By June, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs collectively held ~$125B in assets ccn.com. This wave of institutional money not only provides a price-insensitive base of buyers (smoothing volatility), but also is reshaping market dynamics – Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to near parity with equities as long-term ETF holders dampen wild swings tronweekly.com. The success of IBIT and its peers is “reshaping the ETF and crypto landscapes alike,” heralding a new era where bitcoin is a core component of mainstream portfolios tronweekly.com.\nOverall, the flurry of partnerships, M&amp;A, and funding in mid-2025 paints a picture of accelerating institutionalization of crypto. As one industry report put it, “the past week marked a turning point in the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto industry”, with major deals underscoring the melding of old and new finance aminagroup.com aminagroup.com. Crypto startups are tapping public markets and large private checks, legacy institutions are launching or acquiring crypto products, and even banks are directly issuing digital assets. This rapid integration trend is expected to continue through 2025, as both crypto-native firms and traditional financial giants collaborate to build the next generation of financial infrastructure.\nGovernment and Regulatory Developments (US, EU, Asia &amp; More)\nRegulatory clarity (or lack thereof) continues to be a critical factor for the crypto industry. In the first half of 2025, governments around the world made significant moves to establish rules for digital assets, with generally positive implications for the market. Below we break down the key developments by region:\nUnited States: After years of uncertainty, the U.S. is finally seeing concrete crypto legislation and more accommodating oversight. In June, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill that would create the first federal licensing framework for stablecoin issuers dlapiper.com. The Act (which must still be reconciled with the House’s version, the STABLE Act) would mandate prudential standards and oversight for stablecoin providers, effectively giving legal recognition to fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies if signed into law. This comes as stablecoin usage soars and policymakers seek to guard against risks without stifling innovation. Meanwhile, the regulatory stance of key agencies has softened under new leadership. A crypto-friendly shift in Washington followed the 2024 elections – notably, a new SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, took office and has adopted a more innovation-forward approach investopedia.com investopedia.com. On June 9, SEC Chair Atkins announced plans for a “conditional innovation exemption” – essentially directing SEC staff to explore exemptive relief for DeFi and crypto projects that operate in good faith but don’t fit neatly into existing rules dlapiper.com. He suggested an “innovation sandbox” that would allow on-chain products and services to go to market under certain conditions, rather than forcing everything through enforcement. Atkins also highlighted the importance of self-custody and peer-to-peer transactions, echoing Commissioner Hester Peirce’s view that DeFi embodies core American values of financial freedom dlapiper.com. This is a stark contrast to the SEC’s enforcement-heavy stance in prior years. In fact, just before this, on May 29 the SEC’s Corporation Finance division issued a statement clarifying that protocol-level staking on proof-of-stake networks does not constitute a securities offering dlapiper.com. This was a huge relief for networks like Ethereum, as it signaled that simply participating in validating a PoS blockchain (and earning rewards) is not akin to dealing securities in the SEC’s eyes. Together, these signals indicate a major regulatory thaw in the U.S.: regulators are moving from punishment toward guidance and accommodation. Other U.S. agencies have followed suit: the Department of Labor (DOL) rescinded its 2022 guidance that discouraged including crypto in 401(k) retirement plans dlapiper.com, reverting to a neutral stance that leaves the decision to fiduciaries (the prior guidance had been a barrier for any employer wanting to offer Bitcoin in retirement portfolios). Additionally, the IRS extended the compliance deadline for new crypto tax reporting rules – brokers won’t have to start issuing 1099-DA forms for crypto transactions until 2027 now dlapiper.com dlapiper.com, giving exchanges and taxpayers more time to adapt to forthcoming regulations. Enforcement has not disappeared – state regulators and the DOJ continue to pursue scams (e.g., Alabama’s Securities Commission seized funds from a crypto scam in June) dlapiper.com and insider trading cases – but there’s a sense that legitimate actors are finally getting frameworks to operate in. Crucially, the SEC’s approvals of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in late 2024 (under pressure from courts and a more receptive Commission) have opened the floodgates to institutional participation investopedia.com tronweekly.com. By mid-2025, a dozen Bitcoin and Ether ETFs are trading, and this SEC under Atkins appears amenable to further products (like pending XRP spot ETF filings awaiting a decision coindcx.com). The combination of legislative progress (the stablecoin bill, draft proposals on exchange and custody regulation) and a friendlier SEC has markedly improved the U.S. regulatory climate compared to the crackdowns of 2022–23. Industry advocates are optimistic the U.S. will pass comprehensive crypto legislation by year-end – covering stablecoins and possibly market structure – which could solidify the country’s stance and provide much-needed clarity for entrepreneurs and investors.\nEuropean Union: Europe entered 2025 with a comprehensive regulatory framework (MiCA) already in place, making it arguably the most crypto-friendly major jurisdiction. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation fully came into effect in January 2025 dlapiper.com, establishing unified rules for crypto asset issuers and service providers across all 27 member states. Under MiCA, companies can obtain a single license (in one EU country) that passport authorizes them to operate throughout the bloc reuters.com. This has kicked off a race among crypto firms to become MiCA-compliant and secure an EU foothold. In June, two of the world’s largest crypto companies – Gemini and Coinbase – were reported to be on the verge of obtaining MiCA licenses reuters.com reuters.com. Gemini is set to receive its license from Malta (which has moved quickly under MiCA), and Coinbase is poised for approval by Luxembourg’s regulator reuters.com reuters.com. These licenses would grant them pan-European access. However, the rapid approvals by smaller states like Malta have caused some friction: France’s AMF has warned of a potential “race to the bottom” in regulatory standards if some jurisdictions rubber-stamp licenses too fast reuters.com. ESMA (the EU-wide market authority) has been reviewing Malta’s licensing spree, amid concerns that uneven enforcement could undermine MiCA’s intent reuters.com reuters.com. Despite these debates, it’s clear that MiCA has attracted major crypto business to Europe – in contrast to the U.S., where some firms felt compelled to pause or exit in 2023’s hostile climate. By mid-2025, Europe stands as a highly attractive market with clear rules: exchanges are expanding there, and even U.S.-based entities are choosing EU licensing (e.g. Ripple registering in Ireland in 2024) to future-proof their operations. Additionally, Europe has addressed areas beyond MiCA: for example, France passed a law (DDADUE, May 2025) explicitly allowing crypto assets to be used as collateral and creating a legal regime for pledging digital assets dlapiper.com dlapiper.com. This fills an important gap by facilitating crypto-backed lending under French law, and aligns with broader EU efforts to integrate crypto into traditional finance. The UK, no longer in the EU but an important market, likewise pushed forward: the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) released consultation papers in May proposing new stablecoin issuance rules and a prudential framework for crypto firms dlapiper.com. The UK is crafting its own version of MiCA-like rules, aiming to strike a balance between innovation and oversight to become a “global cryptoasset technology hub,” as HM Treasury has stated. In summary, Europe’s regulatory environment in 2025 is relatively mature and welcoming – MiCA’s rollout is smoothing out the patchwork of national laws, and regulators are actively supervising the transition (e.g., reviewing how member states issue licenses). As one Reuters report put it, Europe’s approach brings crypto “under the same regulatory umbrella as traditional finance” reuters.com, which could mitigate risks of fraud and market instability reuters.com while giving crypto companies the passporting rights and legitimacy they craved.\nAsia-Pacific: The APAC region features a mosaic of regulatory approaches, but several leading Asian markets have made significant progress in H1 2025 toward clearer crypto regulation medium.com. Hong Kong has pivoted to an aggressively pro-crypto stance as part of its bid to be a global crypto hub. In February 2025, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) published the “ASPIRe” roadmap (Agenda for Sustainable Platform Innovation &amp; Resolution) outlining a comprehensive strategy for crypto oversight medium.com. This 5-point plan includes new licensing regimes for crypto trading platforms, custodians, and even OTC dealers; technology-neutral standards for custody (focusing on security regardless of tech); expanded permissions for products like crypto derivatives for professional investors; investments in regtech for on-chain monitoring; and investor education programs to accompany market growth medium.com medium.com. Hong Kong’s clear intent is to deepen and broaden its crypto markets under a regulated framework, distinguishing its approach from mainland China’s ban. Further, in May 2025 Hong Kong’s legislature passed a Stablecoin Ordinance, slated to take effect August 1, 2025, which will require any issuer of stablecoins pegged to fiat or other assets to be licensed by the HKMA (Hong Kong Monetary Authority) dlapiper.com. The law sets minimum capital requirements, redemption standards, and governance rules for stablecoin issuers, and initially focuses on fiat-pegged stablecoins (like HKD or USD-backed) dlapiper.com. This positions Hong Kong as one of the first jurisdictions with a dedicated stablecoin regulatory regime – a move likely to attract major stablecoin companies to set up in HK (indeed, Circle and others have expressed interest). South Korea has also accelerated its crypto regulatory efforts. A new administration in 2025 placed crypto at the forefront of its innovation agenda medium.com. In June, the government introduced a draft of the Digital Asset Basic Act, a comprehensive bill to expand Korea’s existing crypto regulations medium.com medium.com. Notably, this Basic Act aims to legalize spot Bitcoin ETFs (currently not allowed under older securities laws) medium.com, establish rules for stablecoin issuers (including potentially a won-pegged “KW stablecoin” to bolster domestic control) medium.com, and reform banking partnership rules so that more banks can work with crypto exchanges (breaking the monopoly of a few bank-exchange ties) medium.com. South Korea already implemented the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in 2024, which focused on anti-money laundering and customer protection; the new Basic Act will go further to integrate crypto into the financial system with proper guardrails. South Korea’s regulators (FSC and others) remain proactive – e.g., enforcing strict travel rule compliance – but the tone is constructive, not prohibitive. Japan, a longtime leader in crypto regulation, made targeted updates to foster growth. In June, Japan’s Diet (parliament) approved amendments proposed by the Financial Services Agency to create a new licensing category for crypto broker-dealers medium.com. Previously, any entity dealing in crypto needed a full exchange license; now, limited broker licenses allow firms to operate as intermediaries (facilitating trades) without running an order-book exchange, lowering the barrier to entry medium.com. This change is expected to bring in new startups and foreign players who found the old regime too burdensome. Japan also fine-tuned its stablecoin regulations – having legalized stablecoins issued by banks and trust companies in 2022, in 2025 the FSA relaxed reserve asset rules to allow up to 50% of reserves to be held in low-risk bonds (vs 100% cash previously) medium.com. This gives stablecoin issuers more flexibility and could improve yields, making issuance more attractive while still protecting holders (via the trust structure that segregates reserves) medium.com medium.com. Singapore, which had already enacted a forward-looking framework for single-currency stablecoins in 2023, continued on its course, maintaining clear licensing under the Payment Services Act and high standards for reserve backing and disclosure medium.com. The MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) signaled intent to revise guidelines as needed to keep pace, but Singapore’s environment remains one of the most welcoming, especially for DeFi and fintech innovation (with licensed entities like DBS Bank issuing tokenized bonds and exploring DeFi liquidity pools under regulatory sandboxes). In contrast, China remains officially closed to cryptocurrency trading – a ban on exchanges and mining has been in effect since 2021 – though it vigorously pursues development of its central bank digital currency (e-CNY). Interestingly, some speculate that Hong Kong’s crypto opening provides an experimental conduit for Chinese capital to access crypto under the guise of Hong Kong’s rules, but mainland authorities have not openly endorsed this. India, on the other hand, continues to take a hard line fiscally – the steep 30% tax on crypto gains and 1% TDS on trades implemented in 2022 are still in place, which has severely dampened domestic trading volumes (driving activity offshore) isbglasgow.com. However, India has not banned crypto, and there are signs of policy re-think especially if global standards emerge (India’s government indicated it would wait for a global consensus via the G20 before formalizing its stance further).\nMiddle East &amp; Other Regions: In the Middle East, the UAE (particularly Dubai) has solidified its status as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) has been actively licensing firms under its 2022 framework. In a notable development, Dubai approved Ripple to launch a stablecoin (RLUSD) tied to the US Dollar on a trial basis aminagroup.com – showcasing the emirate’s openness to new products (Ripple’s RLUSD is among the first bank-issued stablecoins aimed at cross-border settlement). The Gulf region in general has embraced blockchain for both crypto and non-crypto uses (e.g., Bahrain and UAE working on blockchain-based trade finance and digital ID). In Latin America, countries like Brazil have implemented new laws (Brazil’s crypto framework law took effect in 2024, bringing exchanges under central bank supervision), and Argentina and others are exploring CBDCs amid currency challenges. El Salvador remains unique with Bitcoin as legal tender, and it opened a “Bitcoin embassy” in Texas in 2025 to foster cooperation. Africa presents a mixed bag: Nigeria’s eNaira CBDC struggles while crypto adoption at the grassroots remains high; Kenya and South Africa are developing regulations (South Africa treats crypto as a financial product now, requiring licensing of exchanges in 2024). Overall, globally there is momentum toward clearer rules: the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and G20 have issued guidelines urging countries to regulate crypto markets, not ban them, and to synchronize where possible. International coordination is slow but ongoing – for instance, finance ministers of G7 have reiterated support for consistent crypto tax reporting standards and anti-money laundering measures across jurisdictions.\nIn summary, the regulatory winds in 2025 are blowing in a more favorable direction for crypto. The contrast with prior years is stark: the emphasis has shifted from “crackdown” to “framework”. Jurisdictions that were hostile or ambiguous are coming around to creating guidelines that legitimize crypto activity (as seen in the U.S. and Asia), while those that were ahead (EU, Singapore) are reaping the benefits of attracting talent and capital. This is not to say challenges are gone – implementation of new laws will be key, and enforcement against bad actors remains robust. But the overall trend globally is toward integration of crypto into existing legal and financial systems. By laying down rules on licensing, stablecoin reserves, exchange operations, custody, and even DeFi, regulators are bringing crypto into the fold. As the *CEO of Coinbase noted, 2025 might be remembered as the year the “regulatory frost” thawed, ushering in a spring of crypto innovation under clearer skies. The impact on the market is tangible: regulatory clarity is cited by institutions as a main reason for increasing allocation to crypto, and many experts believe that sensible regulation will ultimately expand the crypto market by an order of magnitude by attracting the next wave of participants who were waiting on the sidelines.\nH2 2025 Forecast: Trends and Expert Outlook\nLooking ahead to the second half of 2025, analysts and industry veterans are broadly optimistic but also caution that the market’s next phase could be volatile. Several key themes and predictions have emerged for the remainder of the year:\nBull Market Continuation vs. Cycle Peak: Many experts believe the crypto bull run has further to go before reaching a cycle top. A number of market analysts have repeatedly pointed to $120,000 as a reasonable price target for Bitcoin in 2025 coindesk.com, given the current momentum and improving macro conditions. Factors boosting this case include Bitcoin’s demonstrated resilience above $100K, the prospect of Fed rate cuts in coming months, and bullish technical patterns (e.g. major moving averages aligning in “golden cross” formations) coindesk.com coindesk.com. Some bulls, like those at Bitwise Asset Management, foresee an even higher year-end target around $150K–$200K for BTC, noting that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are all likely to “hit new all-time highs” again in this cycle bitwiseinvestments.com. Bitwise’s team dubbed 2025 the “Golden Age of Crypto” and predicted Bitcoin could trade above $200K with Ethereum also reaching fresh peaks (prior ATH for ETH was ~$4.9K) bitwiseinvestments.com. On the other hand, there are signs that the market may be entering its late-cycle “overheated” phase. Technical indicators like the RSI (relative strength index) on high time frames have entered overbought territory for BTC, which “could imply the final phase of the bull run” coindcx.com. Historically, the last leg of a crypto bull market is when parabolic gains and altcoin “mania” occur – indeed, as one analyst insight noted, “the biggest and quickest gains happen during the last phase of a bull run,” and during this phase, alts tend to outperform BTC coindcx.com. This seems to be playing out in mid-2025: we’ve seen some explosive moves in smaller caps and a resurgence of meme speculation. It suggests caution that while upside remains, the easy gains might be behind us and volatility could intensify if and when the market overheats. Several traders are watching for a potential “blow-off top” in late 2025, after which a more severe correction could ensue (similar to early 2018). For now, market sentiment is bullish but tempered – the Fear &amp; Greed Index in June was ~71 (Greed) which indicates optimism yet not full-blown euphoria coindcx.com. This leaves room for a final FOMO-driven surge before sentiment overheats.\nMacroeconomic Wildcards: The macro backdrop will heavily influence crypto’s direction in H2. The base case many experts foresee is a gentle economic landing with falling inflation and the start of central bank easing. If the U.S. Fed indeed cuts rates by Q4 2025 (some forecasts call for at least one 25 bps cut by December, contingent on CPI staying low), that liquidity infusion could drive both stocks and crypto higher, extending the bull run coindesk.com. Lower interest rates typically improve the appeal of risk assets and decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like gold or Bitcoin. Additionally, continued declines in inflation or energy prices would be positive for the narrative of Bitcoin as a store of value (inflation hedge) with actual year-over-year CPI turning neutral or disinflationary. On the flip side, macro risks include the chance of recession (if high rates from earlier hikes finally slow the economy too much) or a flare-up in inflation due to some supply shock. A recession in major economies could initially hurt crypto as investors de-risk, though some argue Bitcoin might eventually perform well if central banks respond with aggressive stimulus. Geopolitical tensions remain a wildcard – any major conflict or unexpected event (e.g., a credit crisis, geopolitical standoff) could cause a flight to safety that might temporarily hit crypto prices. So far in 2025, Bitcoin has weathered geopolitical events relatively well (even being stable during an Iran–Israel scare as noted coindesk.com), but it’s unclear if that resilience will hold in a more severe crisis. Regulatory decisions are another wild card for H2: for instance, the U.S. stablecoin bill outcome, or any progress on an ETF for Ethereum or other assets, could sway markets. Conversely, if regulators were to come out with surprise restrictions (say, new tax rules or limits on bank crypto activities), that could be a negative shock. The prevailing expert view is that macro and policy factors are more likely to be supportive than not in the coming months – a kind of “Goldilocks” scenario of mild growth, falling inflation, and pro-innovation regulation – which underpins bullish forecasts. Still, seasoned analysts warn traders to stay nimble, as “the only certainty is uncertainty” in a rapidly evolving global landscape.\nAltseason and Sector Rotation: If Bitcoin’s rally stabilizes or slows down near the $120K–$150K region, many predict a classic “altseason” could play out in late 2025. Already, there are signs of capital rotating to high-beta altcoins – the dominance of Bitcoin dipped slightly from its peak as coins like XRP, SOL, and smaller caps had spurts of outperformance in June. Sectors to watch in H2 include: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – especially if U.S. regulators implement the kind of “DeFi innovation exemptions” discussed, which could spark a wave of new DeFi product launches in the U.S. without fear of immediate enforcement dlapiper.com. A more permissive stance could re-rate DeFi tokens upward (indeed UNI and AAVE jumped on hints of such policy aminagroup.com). Layer-1 and Layer-2 Tokens – as Ethereum’s fees are expected to remain reasonable post-Pectra, L2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync token if one launches) might see increased usage and valuation. Competing L1s like Solana, Avalanche, and Cardano could also ride a wave of speculative interest, especially as they demonstrate technical milestones (e.g. Solana Firedancer launch). AI and Web3 Crossover – a unique trend predicted by some (Bitwise’s Prediction #5) is the rise of “tokens launched by AI agents” and an accompanying memecoin mania bigger than 2024’s bitwiseinvestments.com. We already saw AI-themed tokens pump earlier in 2025; this could escalate if hype around generative AI merges with crypto (imagine AI-generated meme tokens going viral). Such a scenario would be highly speculative but is plausible in a liquidity-fueled exuberant market. Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization – on a more fundamental note, many expect a boom in tokenization of traditional assets (bonds, real estate, commodities) on blockchain. Institutions like BlackRock have been piloting tokenized bond ETFs, and Bitwise predicted the value of tokenized real-world assets could surpass $50B by end of year bitwiseinvestments.com. Growth in this area would validate use cases for crypto beyond currency – and could bring in a new class of investors interested in on-chain treasuries, for example. Gaming and Metaverse – after cooling in 2022–23, crypto gaming might get a second wind if the bull market continues. Improved scalability (thanks to L2s) and the broader tech hype cycle (e.g., Apple’s new AR/VR devices launching) might rekindle interest in metaverse and NFT-related tokens in late 2025.\nTechnological Roadmap: On the development front, the latter half of 2025 will see work beginning on Ethereum’s next upgrades after Pectra. The Ethereum community is discussing “danksharding” – fully implementing sharding to massively raise throughput – which could potentially roll out in 2026. Any progress or testnets for that could be bullish for ETH sentiment, as it reinforces the trajectory of continuous improvement coinbase.com coinbase.com. Ethereum’s proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) already laid groundwork; if devs announce a timeline for full sharding, it may excite investors and users (more scaling = more adoption potential). Additionally, we may see more Ethereum Layer-2 launches (e.g., Scroll, Taiko generalize ZK-rollups) and Layer-3 experiments (stacked rollups for specialized purposes) – these won’t necessarily drive price directly but showcase a rich innovation pipeline. In Bitcoin’s world, there’s anticipation of technological proposals like ANYprevout and Drivechains being debated, which could enhance Bitcoin’s smart contract and sidechain capabilities. If one of those gets closer to deployment (via soft fork), it could add new narratives to Bitcoin (like enabling more complex DeFi on Bitcoin sidechains). Interoperability will also advance: projects connecting different chains (Cosmos, Polkadot) might announce upgrades making cross-chain transfers smoother and safer (important after 2022’s bridge hacks). Security and regulatory tech: Given the regulatory push, expect new compliance tech – for example, zero-knowledge compliance proofs that let DeFi protocols verify user compliance without sharing all data. This kind of “RegTech meets Crypto” could be a theme, especially if the U.S. or EU launches pilot programs with the industry to oversee DeFi in a hands-off way. Lastly, CBDC progress might accelerate – several countries (Australia, Canada, Japan) are expected to reveal results of their CBDC pilots in late 2025. While CBDCs are somewhat tangential to the crypto markets (some see them as competitors to stablecoins), their advancement often spurs public discussion about digital currencies, indirectly shining a light on Bitcoin and stablecoins as alternatives.\nExpert Sentiment &amp; Quotes: Industry leaders remain mostly bullish. For instance, Mike Novogratz of Galaxy Digital recently suggested Bitcoin’s structure “feels like we’ll hit $150K before the next election,” citing institutional flows. Cathie Wood of ARK Invest reiterated her super-bullish long-term view, though ARK tempered near-term expectations by splitting its Bitcoin ETF shares to increase accessibility cointelegraph.com. On the cautious side, some analysts warn of a potential “double top” scenario for Bitcoin if it struggles to break decisively above the $110K–$120K range – CoinDesk noted BTC spent ~50 days oscillating between $100K and $110K by late June, potentially signaling uptrend exhaustion near January’s highs if buyers don’t push it further coindesk.com. QCP Capital (a crypto trading firm) commented that the market could be entering a grind-up phase lacking the frenzy of earlier moves, meaning returns might normalize. Despite these cautionary takes, the overall expert consensus leans positive for H2 2025: in a CoinDesk survey of fund managers, the majority expected higher crypto prices by year-end, citing factors like ETF-driven “structural demand,” improving macro, and the historical pattern of post-halving rallies.\nTo encapsulate the sentiment, crypto is entering H2 2025 with strong tailwinds – a growing user base, institutional acceptance, and clearer regulations – but also with a heightened awareness that markets move in cycles. Wise investors are deploying with optimism and caution: as one analysis put it, “cautiously bullish” is the mantra coindcx.com. The remainder of the year will test whether crypto can live up to the “Golden Age” moniker or whether it will face a cooling-off period after its blistering run. Key things to watch include: Federal Reserve meetings (any sign of dovish pivot or surprise hawkishness), the progress of the US crypto bills (stablecoin and potentially a broader market structure bill), Europe’s MiCA licensing wave (do major players successfully passport across EU?), Asia’s stablecoin and exchange regimes (Hong Kong’s first licenses under new rules, Japan’s new entrants), and the cadence of tech breakthroughs (will Ethereum maintain rapid improvement, will Solana’s Firedancer deliver as promised?). By early 2026, we’ll also have Bitcoin’s next halving on the horizon, so late 2025 will be crucial for setting the stage going into that event.\nIn conclusion, June 2025 finds the crypto industry at new heights – both in market value and in legitimacy – with momentum likely to carry forward. As one market strategist summarized, Bitcoin and Ethereum’s rallies, “buoyed by encouraging inflation data and positive exchange flows, coincide with a broader resurgence in DeFi amid improving regulatory clarity – all pointing to a market coming of age” aminagroup.com. The foundation built in the first half of 2025 in terms of price appreciation, technological upgrades, and institutional buy-in provides a strong springboard for the second half. If current trends hold, 2025 could indeed be remembered as the year crypto firmly entrenched itself in the global financial system – entering 2026 bigger, more integrated, and more resilient than ever aminagroup.com aminagroup.com.\nSources:\nAmina Bank Research – Crypto Market Monitor Mid-June 2025 aminagroup.com aminagroup.com\nCoinDesk Markets – Bitcoin above $110K coverage coindesk.com coindesk.com; $120K outlook coindesk.com\nCoinDCX Blog – Top Cryptos June 2025 (market data and insights) coindcx.com coindcx.com\nReuters – EU regulatory developments (MiCA licensing) reuters.com reuters.com\nDLA Piper – Blockchain &amp; Digital Assets News (June 2025) (US regulations summary) dlapiper.com dlapiper.com\nCCN News – June 2025 Institutional Moves (ETFs, IPOs, fundraising) ccn.com ccn.com\nTronWeekly News – BlackRock ETF milestones tronweekly.com tronweekly.com\nMedium (Coinmonks) – Crypto Regulation in Asia H1 2025 medium.com medium.com\nInvestopedia – Bitcoin Price History update 2024–25 investopedia.com\nBinance Research – Global market cap surpassing $3T binance.com\n\nTop 10 AI Chatbots Dominating 2025 – Conversational…\nXRP and Ripple Labs in 2025: SEC Lawsuit Updates,…\nLatest Digital Trends as of Mid‑2025 (Updated: June…\nTechnology Trends 2025: Global Innovations in AI,…\nPoland Real Estate Market 2025: Trends, Prices,…\nGlobal Art Market Report 2024–2025\n\nTags: Blockchain, Crypto, Market Trends\n\nPost navigation\nPrevious: Previous post: Mexico Drone Laws 2025: Regulations, Requirements, and Recent Updates\nNext: Next post: Blockchain Technology Comprehensive Report 2025: Background, Evolution, Trends &amp; Future Outlook (26th of June 2025).\n\nToday’s Space, Satellite, AI &amp; Tech News\n\nJapan Launches GOSAT-GW Satellite to Tackle Climate CrisisJapan's space agency JAXA launched the dual-purpose GOSAT-GW satellite on the H-2A rocket's final mission.

At its core, a blockchain consists of a chain of data blocks linked together using cryptography; each block contains a bundle of transactions and a hash (digital fingerprint) referencing the previous block, forming an immutable chain geeksforgeeks.org geeksforgeeks.org. This design ensures that once a block is added, its data cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks, providing immutability and tamper-resistance. Transactions are validated by network nodes and grouped into blocks, which are then confirmed by achieving distributed consensus – an agreement among the network on the block’s validity geeksforgeeks.org. Common consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), where nodes solve complex puzzles (as in Bitcoin), and Proof of Stake (PoS), where validators “stake” tokens for the right to add new blocks (as used in modern Ethereum) geeksforgeeks.org. This consensus-driven validation, combined with cryptographic security, allows blockchains to replace the need for a trusted third-party with mathematical proof and distributed agreement on “truth” cryptoaltruism.org brainyquote.com.\nKey Components: In a blockchain network, nodes (computers) maintain copies of the ledger and participate in validation geeksforgeeks.org. Each node sees all transactions, fostering transparency, while the distributed nature (many nodes) provides decentralization, eliminating single points of failure geeksforgeeks.org. Transactions are cryptographically signed by users (using private/public key pairs) to ensure authenticity and security. When transactions are broadcast, nodes verify them and, via the consensus algorithm, agree on which transactions to confirm and append. Confirmed transactions are grouped into a block with a timestamp and the previous block’s hash, then appended to the chain geeksforgeeks.org – hence the term blockchain. This structure yields a shared ledger where all participants have a consistent view of data that is extremely difficult to falsify or tamper with geeksforgeeks.org. Additional supporting elements often include smart contracts (programmable self-executing agreements stored on the chain) and cryptographic tokens or cryptocurrency incentives for network participants geeksforgeeks.org geeksforgeeks.org.\nPublic vs. Private Blockchains: There are different types of blockchains tailored to use case needs. Public (permissionless) blockchains (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) are open networks that anyone can join and read or write transactions. They are fully decentralized with no single owner; security is maintained by consensus rules and economic incentives (e.g. mining rewards). Data on public chains is transparent and highly secure – once validated on-chain, records cannot be easily altered geeksforgeeks.org geeksforgeeks.org. In public blockchains, participants are typically pseudonymous, and no central entity controls the network. Private (permissioned) blockchains, by contrast, restrict participation to known, authorized members (often within a company or consortium). A private blockchain is usually operated by one or a few entities (more centralized control), which manage network membership and governance geeksforgeeks.org. These permissioned networks trade some decentralization for privacy, speed, and efficiency – data and transaction details might only be visible to permissioned participants, making them suitable for enterprise use where data confidentiality is important geeksforgeeks.org geeksforgeeks.org. In general, private blockchains can achieve higher throughput (transactions per second) and lower latency since they involve fewer nodes and often use simpler consensus protocols (or even a trusted intermediary for ordering transactions) geeksforgeeks.org geeksforgeeks.org. There are also consortium or hybrid blockchains, where multiple organizations operate a shared permissioned ledger – these aim to combine the trust of blockchain with controlled access (e.g. Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Corda are frameworks enabling such consortium chains). Each type has its place: public chains excel at open ecosystems and censorship-resistance, while private/consortium chains are popular in enterprise settings that require privacy, compliance, or specific performance guarantees.\n(Figure: Schematic of how blockchain transactions are grouped into blocks, secured by hashes, and validated by a distributed network – ensuring a tamper-proof ledger.)\nBlockchain’s consensus mechanisms and cryptographic design solve the longstanding issue of trust in digital transactions. In traditional systems, a central authority (like a bank) is needed to prevent double-spending and ensure everyone has the same transaction history. Blockchains achieve this trust algorithmically: nodes collectively verify transactions and reach agreement, so participants can trust the ledger’s integrity without trusting any single intermediary. As blockchain advocate Andreas Antonopoulos puts it, “gradually, decentralized trust will be accepted as a new and effective trust model” for transactions, much as the internet enabled new models of information exchange brainyquote.com. In summary, a blockchain network provides a foundation where data integrity, transparency, and security are built in, enabling unforgeable transaction histories and new forms of decentralized collaboration.\nHistory and Evolution\nBlockchain technology emerged from the confluence of decades of research in cryptography, distributed systems, and digital currency. Below is a timeline of major milestones in the evolution of blockchain:\n1991: Researchers Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta introduced the concept of a cryptographically secured chain of data as a way to timestamp digital documents and ensure they could not be backdated or tampered with techtarget.com. They described linking records in a chain of hashes, laying the conceptual groundwork for what would later be called blockchain. In 1992, they incorporated Merkle trees (hash trees) into the design to aggregate multiple documents into one block, further enhancing efficiency geeksforgeeks.org.\n1998–2004: Several pioneers proposed digital money systems that hinted at elements of blockchain. Computer scientists like Nick Szabo (with “Bit Gold”) and Wei Dai (“b-money”) envisioned decentralized currency. In 2000, Stefan Konst published theories on cryptographic secured chains geeksforgeeks.org. In 2004, Hal Finney introduced Reusable Proof of Work (RPoW), a mechanism for reusable digital tokens using PoW – an idea that directly influenced later cryptocurrency designs geeksforgeeks.org.\n2008: The modern blockchain breakthrough came with Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” Nakamoto combined prior innovations (cryptographic chains, distributed networks, proof-of-work consensus) to propose Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency built on a blockchain techtarget.com. The Bitcoin design introduced a public, append-only ledger (the blockchain) to record all transactions, secured by miners solving PoW puzzles. This solved the “double-spending” problem without any central authority, a landmark achievement in digital trust.\n2009: Bitcoin’s network launch. In January 2009, Bitcoin’s genesis block was mined, marking the first real-world blockchain deployment techtarget.com. The first Bitcoin transaction soon followed (Satoshi sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney) techtarget.com. Bitcoin’s early years demonstrated that a blockchain-based currency could function securely at scale. Though initially worth virtually nothing, Bitcoin gained users and value over time, proving the viability of blockchain as a decentralized ledger for digital money. By eliminating intermediaries and leveraging consensus, Bitcoin showed that strangers globally could agree on a single source of truth (the blockchain) for transactions.\n2013–2015: Evolution to Blockchain 2.0. As Bitcoin grew, technologists began to see broader potential for blockchain beyond cryptocurrency. In late 2013, Vitalik Buterin proposed Ethereum – a blockchain designed not just for currency, but for decentralized applications. Ethereum’s whitepaper (2013) and subsequent launch in 2015 introduced the concept of smart contracts – programs that run on the blockchain and execute automatically when conditions are met techtarget.com techtarget.com. The Ethereum Frontier network went live in July 2015, enabling developers worldwide to write smart contracts in Solidity and deploy dApps (decentralized applications). This was a turning point often dubbed Blockchain 2.0, as the focus expanded from digital cash to general-purpose computation on blockchain. 2015 also saw major moves in enterprise blockchain: the Linux Foundation launched the Hyperledger project to develop open-source blockchain frameworks, and a coalition of banks formed the R3 Corda consortium to explore blockchain in finance techtarget.com. These initiatives marked the rise of enterprise blockchain platforms, separating the technology’s identity from just Bitcoin and opening the door to industry-specific distributed ledgers.\n2016–2017: Expansion and hype. The term “blockchain” itself entered the mainstream, and startups and enterprises raced to pilot the technology. In 2016, major events included the first high-profile smart contract failure (the DAO hack on Ethereum), which led to a contentious hard fork of Ethereum’s blockchain geeksforgeeks.org. By 2017, enthusiasm was soaring: Bitcoin’s price hit record highs (approaching $20k) and initial coin offerings (ICOs) proliferated as new projects used Ethereum to raise capital. Governments and regulators took notice – for example, Japan in 2017 officially recognized Bitcoin as legal tender geeksforgeeks.org. New blockchain networks launched, such as EOS (aiming for high performance dApps) geeksforgeeks.org. A Deloitte survey in 2017 found 15% of global banks were already using or experimenting with blockchain technology techtarget.com. This period solidified that blockchain was more than a fad: it spurred a wave of innovation (and speculation), comparable in buzz to the early internet boom.\n2018–2019: Reassessment and building. After the 2017 hype, the cryptocurrency market cooled in 2018 (Bitcoin’s value fell sharply). Tech giants and governments, however, continued investing in blockchain. In 2018, Facebook, Google, and Twitter banned crypto ads amid regulatory concerns techtarget.com, but behind the scenes, development continued. The European Commission launched the Blockchain Observatory and Forum to support blockchain innovation in Europe techtarget.com. By 2019, enterprise adoption picked up pace: for example, Walmart deployed a food traceability system using Hyperledger Fabric to track produce supply chains, improving safety and transparency techtarget.com. Amazon introduced Amazon Managed Blockchain on AWS, offering blockchain-as-a-service to businesses techtarget.com. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s network activity grew — by mid-2019, Ethereum was processing over 1 million transactions per day techtarget.com, reflecting heavy use from dApps and token transfers.\n2020–2022: Maturation and integration. A pivotal development in late 2020 was the launch of Ethereum 2.0’s Beacon Chain, beginning the network’s transition from PoW to PoS for better scalability techtarget.com. Stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like USD) surged in use around 2020, offering less volatility; they became critical for trading and payments, foreshadowing blockchain’s integration with traditional finance techtarget.com. By 2021, blockchain had firmly entered the public consciousness: Bitcoin hit an all-time price near $69k, major companies (Tesla, MicroStrategy) added crypto to their balance sheets, and the explosion of DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFTs demonstrated new blockchain use cases (the NFT art market hit mainstream news when a digital artwork sold for $69M at Christie’s in 2021) techtarget.com techtarget.com. The global blockchain market was valued at only ~$6 billion in 2021, but was projected to grow to over $1 trillion by 2030, illustrating the massive expectations ahead techtarget.com. In 2022, a marquee moment was Ethereum’s Merge – the successful switch of Ethereum’s consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, reducing the network’s energy consumption by ~99.95% techtarget.com and setting the stage for future scalability upgrades. This era also saw many governments and central banks actively researching or launching CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) using blockchain-inspired technology, as discussed later.\nIn summary, blockchain technology has evolved from a niche proposal in 2008 to a widespread platform for innovation by the mid-2020s. What began with Bitcoin’s blockchain 1.0 (digital currency) expanded with Ethereum’s blockchain 2.0 (smart contracts and dApps), followed by enterprise and consortium blockchains aiming to transform business processes (sometimes called blockchain 3.0). Each stage brought broader adoption and technical refinement. The technology’s history is marked by rapid growth, periodic hype and corrections, and continuous improvement in scalability, security, and functionality. Today, blockchains underpin a diverse range of applications well beyond cryptocurrency – from supply chain management to digital identity – reflecting an evolution from a single use case to a foundational digital infrastructure.\nMarket Trends and Use Cases\nBlockchain has transitioned from an experimental technology to an increasingly integral part of many industries. Current market trends show accelerating global adoption, with innovative use cases emerging in finance, supply chains, healthcare, gaming, government services, and more. Below we analyze key sectors and the top blockchain networks driving usage in 2025:\nFinancial Services and DeFi: Blockchain’s first and most prominent impact is in finance. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are used as stores of value and for peer-to-peer payments, but even more transformative is the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) on smart contract platforms like Ethereum. DeFi protocols enable lending, borrowing, trading, and yield-earning without traditional banks. By late 2021, DeFi applications had amassed over $200 billion in total value locked (capital in smart contracts), a 600% increase from the year prior techtarget.com. Although the crypto market has fluctuated, DeFi continues to grow in sophistication, providing services like automated market maker exchanges (e.g. Uniswap) and crypto-collateralized loans to millions worldwide. Another major trend is the widespread use of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies (mostly USD). Stablecoins have become one of blockchain’s “killer apps,” enabling fast, cheap global payments and remittances a16zcrypto.com. In fact, in Q2 2024, stablecoins facilitated $8.5 trillion in transaction volume across 1.1 billion transactions, more than double the volume processed by Visa ($3.9T) in the same period a16zcrypto.com. This astonishing usage underscores that digital dollars on blockchain are being used for everyday commerce, cross-border transfers, and as a safe harbor in volatile markets. Stablecoins now account for ~32% of daily active addresses on blockchains (by far the largest use after DeFi at 34%) a16zcrypto.com, indicating significant real-world adoption beyond trading. Traditional banks and fintech firms are also leveraging blockchain for settlement and interbank payments – for example, JPMorgan’s Onyx platform uses a private blockchain for instant wholesale payments, and dozens of central banks are experimenting with CBDCs to modernize monetary systems. Overall, in finance, blockchain is streamlining payments and reducing dependence on intermediaries, while unlocking new models like decentralized exchanges and tokenized assets. It is telling that global investment companies are exploring blockchain-based assets (e.g. BlackRock’s proposed Bitcoin ETF), and 83% of financial services executives surveyed by Deloitte viewed blockchain as a strategic priority as early as 2020 techtarget.com.\nSupply Chain and Logistics: Blockchain is tackling longstanding challenges in supply chain management by introducing greater transparency, traceability, and efficiency. In complex supply chains, multiple parties (manufacturers, suppliers, shippers, retailers) need to share data but often mistrust or lack coordination. Blockchain’s shared ledger provides a “single source of truth” about goods in transit, provenance, certifications, and handoffs, which all parties can trust. A notable example is IBM Food Trust, a blockchain-based tracking system used by companies like Walmart to monitor food from farm to store. By recording each step (harvest, processing, transport, etc.) on a blockchain, IBM Food Trust dramatically reduces the time needed to trace contamination sources – from days or weeks down to mere seconds techtarget.com techtarget.com. This improves food safety and accountability. Similarly, shipping giant Maersk (with IBM) piloted TradeLens, a blockchain to digitize global trade documentation and tracking, reducing paperwork and delays (though it faced adoption hurdles). Provenance tracking for luxury goods, raw materials, and pharmaceuticals has also seen success: for instance, Everledger uses blockchain to track diamonds and verify their ethical sourcing, and the MediLedger network allows pharmaceutical companies to authenticate drugs (helping fight counterfeits) using a permissioned blockchain. Traceability is a key selling point – blockchain records can detail a product’s journey, which is invaluable for recalls, audits, and sustainability claims. Beyond traceability, blockchain can streamline supply chain finance: by having an immutable record of transactions and orders, companies can more easily secure financing or insurance (banks can trust the on-chain data). In 2017, a consortium of European banks created a trade finance platform (we.trade) on blockchain to facilitate open account trading and automate invoice settlement techtarget.com. The transparency and efficiency gains are significant – IBM’s ex-CEO Ginni Rometty famously said “anything that can be conceived of as a supply chain, blockchain can vastly improve its efficiency” by removing frictions and enabling trust among participants cryptoaltruism.org. Today, many logistics and retail firms have moved from pilots to production deployments of blockchain for inventory tracking, origin verification, and vendor coordination. The trend is towards consortium blockchains in supply chain (often built on platforms like Hyperledger Fabric) that connect stakeholders and reduce fraud, errors, and administrative costs.\nHealthcare and Public Sector: The healthcare industry is exploring blockchain for secure data sharing and improved patient outcomes. Healthcare data management is notoriously siloed and vulnerable, but blockchain offers a way to give patients and providers a single, tamper-proof history of medical records, prescriptions, and treatments. Several hospitals and tech firms have trialed blockchain for electronic health records (EHRs) to enable patient-controlled sharing of data with privacy. For example, Estonia’s national health system uses a blockchain-like infrastructure (Keyless Signature Infrastructure) to secure millions of health records, ensuring data integrity and allowing audits of who accessed information. Blockchain is also being used to fight counterfeit drugs: the MediLedger network (a consortium including pharma companies and wholesalers) uses blockchain to verify drug supply chains and comply with DSCSA regulations, ensuring medicines can be traced to legitimate sources. More broadly, a 2023 analysis noted thousands of publications and projects on blockchain in healthcare, reflecting growing global interest frontiersin.org. Key use cases include patient identity management, clinical trial data sharing, insurance billing (to detect fraud), and vaccine distribution tracking (as seen during COVID-19). Security is a driving factor: healthcare data breaches are costly and common, and experts note blockchain’s ability to bolster data integrity. By using cryptographic techniques and decentralization, “blockchain-powered data storage can enhance the privacy and integrity of medical data”, helping minimize unauthorized access and tampering in healthcare records weforum.org. Governments and the broader public sector have likewise been tapping blockchain. For instance, digital identity initiatives using blockchain are underway in countries like Canada and Sierra Leone (for secure ID and credential verification). Voting systems based on blockchain have been piloted in places such as West Virginia (for military absentee voting) and in municipal elections in Switzerland, aiming to create tamper-proof, transparent election records – though concerns about security and anonymity persist. Land registries represent another promising area: Georgia, Honduras, and Sweden are among countries that tested blockchain to record property titles, hoping to increase trust and reduce fraud in land ownership records. Even public assistance and aid can leverage blockchain; the United Nations has used Ethereum-based tokens to distribute humanitarian aid to refugees with the World Food Programme’s Building Blocks project, ensuring funds are delivered transparently. Overall, in public services, blockchain is viewed as a tool to increase trust in government processes, reduce corruption (by making records immutable and auditable), and improve administrative efficiency by automating verification of documents and licenses.\nGaming and Digital Entertainment: The gaming industry has embraced blockchain through the advent of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and play-to-earn models. Blockchain enables provable ownership of digital items (characters, skins, cards, etc.), meaning gamers can truly own, trade, or sell their in-game assets outside of the game’s confines. This is a radical shift from traditional games where all assets are ultimately controlled by the publisher. Games like Axie Infinity popularized “play-to-earn” in 2021, where players earn crypto tokens by playing, effectively turning gaming into an income opportunity in some developing countries. Major game studios are now exploring NFTs for items and using blockchain marketplaces for player-to-player trading. By 2024, blockchain adoption in gaming (for asset management) was expected to grow by 45% year-over-year electroiq.com. Beyond games, digital art and media have been revolutionized by NFTs on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Flow, and Solana. Artists, musicians, and creators can sell unique cryptographic tokens representing their work (as seen in the 2021 NFT art boom). These trends indicate a broader Web3 creator economy where blockchain underpins ownership and monetization of digital content. Additionally, new entertainment experiences are emerging: for example, NFT-based collectible card games, metaverse platforms (decentralized virtual worlds like Decentraland or The Sandbox), and fan tokens for sports teams all use blockchain to confer verifiable ownership and governance rights to fans. The gaming sector is also driving technical innovation – demand for fast, low-cost transactions from game players has spurred adoption of high-throughput blockchains (like Solana) and Layer-2 networks to handle microtransactions at scale. In summary, blockchain is empowering users in digital worlds, enabling assets to have real-world value and portability, and fostering communities where players have a stake in the game’s economy. This is blurring the line between virtual and real economies and is a key component of the envisioned metaverse and next-generation online experiences.\nTop Blockchain Networks and Protocols: A handful of blockchain networks dominate usage today, each with different strengths and communities. Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency network (market capitalization and recognition) and is heavily used for value storage and transfers – it processes about ~350,000 transactions per day and has a robust ecosystem (Lightning Network for fast off-chain payments, etc.). Ethereum, however, leads in terms of active utilization due to its smart contract functionality; it hosts thousands of dApps and handles roughly 1 million transactions per day, spanning finance, gaming, NFTs, and more. By 2024, Ethereum’s switch to PoS and the emergence of Layer-2 rollup networks have greatly increased its capacity and lowered fees, reinforcing its position as the “world computer” for decentralized applications. Other major public chains by usage include Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which offers Ethereum-compatible smart contracts with lower fees (BSC has seen wide use in DeFi and gaming, often surpassing Ethereum in daily transaction count), and Tron, notable for high volumes of stablecoin transactions (Tron is popular for USDT transfers). Solana has surged in popularity as well – known for its high throughput (thousands of TPS) and low latency, it accounted for an eye-opening ~100 million active addresses in a recent month (thanks to popular apps and possibly some airdrop-related activity) a16zcrypto.com. In fact, as of late 2024, monthly active crypto addresses hit an all-time high (~220 million), with Solana, NEAR, Coinbase’s Layer-2 Base, Tron, and Bitcoin leading the count, and Ethereum and BNB Chain also each serving millions of active addresses a16zcrypto.com. This shows that activity is spreading across many networks, each carving out niches: e.g. Polygon (a Layer-2/Ethereum sidechain) is big in NFTs and gaming collaborations, Avalanche focuses on speed and has multiple subnets for enterprise, and Polkadot and Cosmos concentrate on interoperability (connecting multiple blockchains together). On the enterprise side, Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum are among the top platforms. Hyperledger Fabric, backed by IBM and the Linux Foundation, is widely used in private consortia – from food supply chains to trade finance – because of its modular architecture and permissioned model techtarget.com techtarget.com. R3 Corda is another popular distributed ledger platform in banking and insurance, enabling direct ledger updates between trusted parties with strong privacy controls. These enterprise-grade blockchains typically do not have a cryptocurrency but instead focus on shared databases and automation via smart contracts in a closed network. It’s worth noting that innovation is robust: new protocols keep emerging (for example, Aptos and Sui introduced in 2022-23 with novel smart contract languages and parallel execution for high performance). Interoperability protocols like Cosmos (IBC protocol) and Polkadot are enabling cross-chain communication, so value and data can move between different blockchains – a crucial development as the ecosystem matures into a “network of networks.” In terms of usage and developer interest, Ethereum still leads in developer community size and “builder energy,” attracting about 21% of Web3 developers (the largest share) a16zcrypto.com. It’s followed by growing interest in Solana, Base, and various Layer-2 networks which are quickly expanding. This healthy multi-chain landscape suggests a future where many specialized blockchains interoperate, rather than a single chain dominating all use cases.\nIn summary, global blockchain adoption trends are very encouraging. We see deepening penetration in finance (from retail crypto trading to institutional settlement), pioneering solutions in supply chain and healthcare that solve real inefficiencies, explosive growth in new digital asset classes like NFTs for gaming and art, and serious exploration by the public sector to leverage blockchain’s trust guarantees. User metrics reinforce this story: the number of active blockchain users and transactions continues to climb to record levels a16zcrypto.com, even as the technology itself becomes more scalable and user-friendly. A Deloitte study noted that over one-third of organizations had blockchain in production by 2020 and the majority considered it a top-five strategic priority techtarget.com – those numbers have only grown since. As industries increasingly recognize blockchain’s ability to create tamper-proof, shared data infrastructures, they are incorporating it into their digital transformation roadmaps. From cutting transaction costs to enabling new business models, blockchain is driving a wave of innovation that is reshaping how we exchange value and information across the economy.\nForecasts and Future Potential\nAs blockchain technology heads toward the latter half of the decade, experts forecast substantial growth in its economic impact, continued technical advances (especially in scalability and interoperability), and a gradually clarifying regulatory environment. Here we outline the anticipated future trajectory of blockchain:\nMarket Growth and Economic Impact: Nearly all analysts agree the blockchain market is poised for explosive expansion. Estimates do vary, but they are uniformly bullish. For example, Statista projects the global blockchain technology market to grow from just ~$6 billion in 2021 to over $1 trillion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) well above 50% techtarget.com. Some research firms are even more optimistic: Grand View Research estimates the market will reach $1.43 trillion by 2030, and MarketsandMarkets expects ~$250 billion by 2029 (from ~$20B in 2024) – different numbers, but all imply an order-of-magnitude growth as blockchain moves from pilot projects to core infrastructure. A famous prediction by Gartner posits that “blockchain will generate $3.1 trillion in new business value by 2030,” meaning the technology’s adoption could drive massive efficiency gains and new business models across industries medium.com. Even if such figures are taken with caution, the direction is clear: blockchain’s role in the global economy is set to dramatically increase. By 2030, it’s expected that blockchain and related technologies (like cryptocurrencies, tokenization, smart contracts) will be mainstream components of financial systems, supply chains, and digital services. The World Economic Forum earlier predicted that by 2027, 10% of the world’s GDP could be stored on blockchain networks – and we’re already seeing signs of that with the rise of tokenized deposits, securities, and Central Bank Digital Currencies in development.\nScaling Solutions (Layer 2 and Beyond): A major focus for the future is improving blockchain scalability – handling many more transactions per second – without sacrificing security or decentralization. Progress on this front is well underway. Layer 2 scaling solutions have rolled out on major platforms: for Bitcoin, the Lightning Network enables instant micropayments by settling transactions off-chain (and only occasionally anchoring to the main chain), greatly increasing throughput for everyday payments. For Ethereum and other smart contract chains, a variety of Layer-2 networks (Optimistic Rollups like Arbitrum and Optimism, ZK-Rollups like StarkNet and zkSync, sidechains like Polygon) are coming of age. These work by processing transactions off the main chain and periodically posting compressed proofs back to it, thereby reducing on-chain load by orders of magnitude. Already, these solutions have drastically reduced transaction costs – for example, sending a stablecoin on an Ethereum Layer-2 like Base costs a few cents in fees, versus a few dollars on the Layer-1 a couple years ago a16zcrypto.com. According to a16z’s analysis, blockchains in 2024 are processing 50× more transactions per second than they were just four years prior, thanks largely to Layer-2 scaling and also the advent of new high-performance Layer-1s a16zcrypto.com. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s roadmap (post-Merge) includes sharding – splitting the blockchain into multiple “shards” to parallelize processing – which could further increase capacity. We also see emerging research into alternative architectures like DAG-based ledgers (directed acyclic graphs used by projects like IOTA and Hedera Hashgraph) to handle high throughput. By 2025 and beyond, it’s expected that users will interact with blockchain applications with near-instant confirmations and negligible fees, as the infrastructure becomes both faster and more user-friendly (potentially even abstracting away the blockchain complexity under the hood). These improvements are critical for blockchain to support mass-market applications (like social networks or gaming with millions of daily users) – and indeed, Gartner highlighted that Layer 2 scaling technologies are one of the recent breakthroughs driving blockchain towards mainstream adoption ledgerinsights.com.\nInteroperability and Network Convergence: In the future, we anticipate a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem. Currently, there are many separate blockchains (each with their own community and use cases), but they operate in silos with limited ability to communicate. Projects like Cosmos (with its Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol) and Polkadot (with its relay chain and parachains model) are spearheading interoperability, allowing assets and data to flow between chains in a secure manner. Gartner’s 2024 analysis identifies cross-chain interoperability as a transformational technology likely to gain traction in the next 2–5 years ledgerinsights.com. The rise of cross-chain bridges and standardized communication protocols will enable a user on one blockchain to seamlessly interact with services on another, unleashing network effects across the whole crypto landscape. For enterprises, this may mean private consortia networks can connect with public networks when needed (for instance, a supply chain blockchain could settle a token payment on a public chain or notarize data to Ethereum for extra security). The concept of the “Internet of Blockchains” is becoming more tangible – much like isolated early computer networks eventually converged into the singular Internet. We expect to see increasing composability across layer-1s and layer-2s, with users barely noticing which chain they’re on, as wallets and apps handle cross-chain transactions behind the scenes. In summary, interoperability and standards will be a key theme, preventing fragmentation and enabling blockchains to collectively support global-scale applications.\nEmerging Use Cases and “Web3”: As the infrastructure matures, entirely new applications are likely to flourish. One such direction is the broader Web3 movement, which envisions a decentralized web where users control their data and identity, and communities govern platforms collectively (often via tokens). We are already seeing early signs: decentralized social media protocols (Lens, Farcaster), creator economies where artists tokenize their work and earn royalties automatically, and integration of blockchain with other frontier tech like AI and IoT. For instance, pairing IoT devices with blockchain ledgers can create trusted data marketplaces (devices publish data which is verified and monetized via blockchain), and blockchain-based decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could govern networks of smart devices or AI services without centralized oversight. A16z’s 2024 report notes that crypto is intersecting with trends like AI and social networks, hinting that blockchain could help solve challenges such as data provenance for AI (tracking how AI models are trained or how data is used) a16zcrypto.com. In gaming, as mentioned, blockchain could underpin entire virtual worlds’ economies (metaverses), and that is expected to continue evolving. Another area to watch is real-world asset tokenization: bringing traditionally illiquid assets (real estate, commodities, even fine art) onto blockchains as digital tokens that can be easily traded and used as collateral. Big institutions like Schwab and Siemens have begun tokenizing parts of their portfolios or issuing bonds on blockchain, and this trend is forecasted to accelerate, potentially unlocking trillions in liquidity from real-world assets by representing them on-chain. Gartner, in fact, points to tokenization of real-world assets as an emerging use case currently in a hype phase, but likely to mature in a few years ledgerinsights.com.\nRegulatory Outlook: The regulatory environment for blockchain and crypto is gradually moving from uncertainty to clarity, though it varies greatly by jurisdiction. By 2025, we expect more defined frameworks to be in place. The European Union has led with the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation, passed in 2023 and rolling out in 2024–25, which sets comprehensive rules for crypto asset issuance, stablecoins, and exchanges across EU member states. This will likely make Europe an attractive environment for blockchain businesses due to clearer rules of the road. In the United States, regulation has been more patchwork, but momentum is building: lawmakers have proposed bills to regulate stablecoin issuers like banks and to define oversight for crypto exchanges, and the SEC and CFTC are actively asserting jurisdiction over various crypto products. By late 2024 or 2025, we may see U.S. legislation that provides clearer definitions of tokens (commodity vs security) and establishes consumer protections for crypto trading, which could spur more institutional involvement. Many other countries (UK, Singapore, UAE, etc.) are also updating laws to balance innovation with risk mitigation (for example, licensing exchanges, setting anti-money-laundering standards, and clarifying tax treatment of crypto assets). Importantly, global coordination is increasing: bodies like the G20 and BIS are discussing international standards for crypto regulation and CBDC interoperability. On the topic of central bank digital currencies, there is a strong indication that they will proliferate: over 114 countries, representing ~95% of global GDP, are exploring or developing CBDCs, and about 11 countries have already fully launched one as of 2023 investing.com. China’s digital yuan (e-CNY) pilot has millions of users, and other nations from Nigeria to Sweden are in advanced trials. While not all CBDCs use blockchain (some use other distributed ledger tech), many do incorporate similar principles of cryptographic transaction records. The rise of CBDCs suggests a future where blockchain-based or inspired digital cash coexists with (and perhaps gradually replaces) physical cash, potentially integrating with public blockchain networks for certain functions. Regulatory acceptance of blockchain is also evident in the way governments are directly supporting the tech (e.g. India launching a national blockchain infrastructure, Dubai aiming to put all government documents on blockchain). We anticipate a harmonization of standards eventually – akin to how the internet forced countries to adopt common protocols – where blockchain networks operating under clear legal frameworks can interconnect globally. Of course, challenges remain: regulators are concerned about investor protection, illicit activity, and financial stability (witness the fallout of unregulated crypto firms in 2022). So the balance of fostering innovation vs. ensuring safeguards will continue to shape the regulatory narrative. Nonetheless, the overall outlook is that regulation will legitimize and enable broader adoption of blockchain by establishing the rules for how digital assets and decentralized networks can operate openly within the law.\nIn conclusion, the future of blockchain technology looks extremely promising. We expect to see wider adoption across industries, where blockchain becomes a behind-the-scenes utility for securely managing data and value. Technological developments like robust Layer-2 networks, cross-chain interoperability, and improved privacy (via techniques like zero-knowledge proofs) will address current limitations and open new frontiers. The innovation pipeline is strong – for instance, researchers are working on more energy-efficient consensus algorithms, better oracle systems for real-world data input, and even quantum-resistant cryptographic methods to future-proof blockchains. Industry analysts often compare the current state of blockchain to the early internet in the 1990s: on the cusp of a breakthrough into ubiquity. Just as websites and e-commerce exploded in the 2000s with improved bandwidth and browsers, one can foresee a similar explosion of Web3 applications as blockchain tech becomes more scalable and user-centric. Expert forecasts reinforce this optimism – whether it’s huge market valuations by 2030 or qualitative visions of decentralized systems empowering individuals worldwide. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder, has articulated that the true success of crypto will come “not because it empowers better people, but because it empowers better institutions” cryptoaltruism.org, hinting that the decentralized systems enabled by blockchain can fundamentally improve how we organize economic and social structures. Many believe we are moving toward a future where trust is established by code rather than intermediaries, and blockchains provide the foundational infrastructure for that paradigm. In summary, if the 2010s were about proving the concept of blockchains, the late 2020s will be about realizing their transformative potential at scale – delivering the benefits of transparency, security, and democratization of value to billions of people.\nExpert Commentary and Quotes\nTo provide additional perspective, here are insights and predictions from leading experts in the blockchain space:\nVitalik Buterin (Co-founder of Ethereum): Vitalik emphasizes the revolutionary goal of blockchain in reshaping societal institutions. He argues that the power of crypto lies in building systems that are fundamentally more trustworthy and fair. “If crypto succeeds, it’s not because it empowers better people. It’s because it empowers better institutions,” Buterin says, underscoring that decentralization can improve the rules and structures that govern our interactions cryptoaltruism.org. On the disruptive potential of decentralization, he also remarked how blockchain shifts the paradigm of control: “Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.” cryptoaltruism.org. This quote vividly illustrates how blockchain can remove centralized intermediaries and empower peer-to-peer activity – whether in finance, ride sharing, or any platform economy – leading to what Buterin calls “real internet-based sovereignty” for users.\nAndreas M. Antonopoulos (Blockchain author and educator): A renowned Bitcoin expert, Antonopoulos often speaks about the paradigm shift in trust models. He points out that society has seen shifts like this before, especially with the internet, and blockchain is another such shift in the context of finance and governance. In his words, “Gradually, decentralized trust will be accepted as a new and effective trust model. We have seen this evolution of understanding before – on the Internet.” brainyquote.com. This insight highlights that initially people are skeptical of decentralized systems, but over time, just as we came to trust internet protocols (e.g. trusting packet routing without a central operator), we will come to trust blockchain’s decentralized consensus as a normal and reliable mechanism. Antonopoulos also famously described Bitcoin as “not just money for the Internet…Bitcoin is the internet of money”, conveying that blockchain-based currency is as revolutionary as email was to postal mail – it creates a global, open system for value exchange that anyone can participate in. His confidence in the irreversibility of this invention is summed up in his quip that you can’t put this genie back in the bottle: “You cannot uninvent this technology. You cannot turn this omelette back into eggs.” goodreads.com. Together, his commentary reinforces the view that blockchain is here to stay and will gradually integrate into the fabric of our digital lives, changing how we trust and transact.\nGinni Rometty (Former CEO of IBM): From an enterprise perspective, Ginni Rometty led one of the biggest corporate pushes into blockchain with IBM’s blockchain unit. She has articulated blockchain’s value for streamlining complex, multi-party processes. One of her noted quotes is: “Anything that can be conceived of as a supply chain, blockchain can vastly improve its efficiency – it doesn’t matter if it’s people, numbers, data, money.” cryptoaltruism.org. This statement reflects the broad applicability that enterprise leaders see in blockchain: wherever multiple parties exchange assets or information, a shared ledger can reduce friction and increase trust. Rometty’s conviction came from early successful pilots in food safety, global shipping, and banking done by IBM, and her quote has often been cited to encourage businesses to re-engineer supply chains and workflows using blockchain to gain transparency and speed. It’s a strong endorsement from a top industry executive that blockchain isn’t just about cryptocurrencies, but about reinventing business processes across the board.\nAnalysts and Industry Researchers (Deloitte and Gartner): Industry research firms have also weighed in with analyses and predictions. Deloitte’s annual blockchain surveys of executives consistently show a robust belief in blockchain’s potential. In 2020, for instance, 55% of senior executives surveyed by Deloitte said blockchain was a critical strategic priority, and a large chunk had already allocated budget to blockchain projects techtarget.com. Deloitte has written that we are “headed to a blockchain winter’s end”, implying the experimentation phase is ending and real deployments are taking off, moving us toward a “blockchain spring” of production systems. Gartner analysts, known for the hype cycle, have been predicting that blockchain will become foundational to competitive advantage in many industries. As noted earlier, Gartner expects blockchain to add trillions of dollars of value to the economy by 2030 medium.com. In 2024’s Hype Cycle report, Gartner highlighted recent advancements such as Layer-2 scaling, DeFi, NFTs, and interoperability as signs that blockchain is climbing out of the “trough of disillusionment” and into practical mainstream use ledgerinsights.com ledgerinsights.com. They foresee technologies like smart contracts, blockchain wallets, and stablecoins reaching mainstream adoption within 2 years, and classify blockchain as “transformational” in the long term for its ability to change industry dynamics ledgerinsights.com ledgerinsights.com. One Gartner distinguished VP, David Furlonger, famously compared the current state of blockchain to the early days of the motor car: cumbersome and sometimes unreliable, but a profound innovation – “Blockchain will be transformative across industries and society… but it will take many years of steady progress and integration before we realize its full promise,” he has advised in summary. The consensus from such experts is that patience and continued innovation will yield a future where blockchain is as ordinary in IT stacks as databases or cloud are today, and the winners will be organizations that proactively experiment and position themselves for that decentralized future.\nThese expert commentaries, spanning technologists, evangelists, corporate leaders, and researchers, all converge on a common theme: blockchain technology has far-reaching potential to reshape systems of value and trust. Whether the focus is enabling new peer-to-peer economies (Buterin, Antonopoulos) or improving existing industry workflows (Rometty, Deloitte), the message is that we are on the cusp of a paradigm shift. The next decade will be critical in translating this potential into reality, guided by the hard-earned wisdom of these experts and the continued collaboration of the global blockchain community.\nSources:\nGeeksforGeeks – “Components of Blockchain Network” (Oct 2024): Definition of blockchain and key features geeksforgeeks.org geeksforgeeks.org.\nGeeksforGeeks – “Difference between Public and Private Blockchain” (May 2022): Characteristics of public vs private blockchains geeksforgeeks.org geeksforgeeks.org.\nTechTarget – “A Timeline and History of Blockchain Technology” (2022): Timeline of blockchain evolution (1979–2022) techtarget.com techtarget.com.\nGeeksforGeeks – “History of Blockchain” (May 2025): Key historical milestones from 1991 through Ethereum and enterprise blockchain rise geeksforgeeks.org geeksforgeeks.org.\nTechTarget – “Top 8 Blockchain Platforms to Consider in 2025” (Jan 2025): Enterprise blockchain platforms and use cases (IBM Food Trust, etc.) techtarget.com techtarget.com.\na16z Crypto – “State of Crypto 2024” (Oct 2024): Data on active addresses, stablecoin volumes, and crypto usage trends a16zcrypto.com a16zcrypto.com.\nLedger Insights – “Gartner Hype Cycle 2024: Stablecoins to Go Mainstream” (Aug 2024): Gartner’s outlook on blockchain adoption timeline and key tech advancements ledgerinsights.com ledgerinsights.com.\nWorld Economic Forum – “How blockchain can improve data security in healthcare” (Dec 2023): Benefits of blockchain for healthcare data integrity weforum.org.\nCryptoAltruism – “15 Quotes about the Potential of Blockchain and Crypto” (Aug 2023): Quotes from Vitalik Buterin, Ginni Rometty, etc., on blockchain’s impact cryptoaltruism.org cryptoaltruism.org.\nBrainyQuote – Andreas Antonopoulos Quote on decentralized trust and the internet brainyquote.com.\nInvesting.com – “114 countries are exploring CBDCs” (Jun 2023) via Atlantic Council data investing.com.\nTechTarget – “Blockchain Timeline / Business Applications” (2022): Stats on enterprise adoption and market size projections techtarget.com techtarget.com.\n\nTop 10 AI Chatbots Dominating 2025 – Conversational…\nTop 10 AI Voice and Speech Technologies Dominating…\nTechnology Trends 2025: Global Innovations in AI,…\nLatest Digital Trends as of Mid‑2025 (Updated: June…\nQuantum Technologies Unleashed: The Ultimate 2025…\n100 Quantum Computing Companies Shaping the Global…\n\nTags: Blockchain, Future Outlook, Future Trends, Technology\n\nPost navigation\nPrevious: Previous post: June 2025 Crypto Market &amp; Blockchain Industry Report: Mid-Year Trends and Outlook\nNext: Next post: Space News Digest: June 2025 / Updated: 2025, June 29th, 00:31 CET\n\nToday’s Space, Satellite, AI &amp; Tech News\n\nJapan Launches GOSAT-GW Satellite to Tackle Climate CrisisJapan's space agency JAXA launched the dual-purpose GOSAT-GW satellite on the H-2A rocket's final mission.

Greed Index has climbed to around 70, reflecting a decidedly bold market mood. Bitcoin’s market dominance sits at a commanding 60% and it’s backed by performance, with the price up 3.3% in June so far. Ethereum rounded off May with its first green monthly candle of the year, surging 40% and has added another 10% since June kicked off.&nbsp;\nIn this edition of the Crypto Market Monitor, we bring you the must-knows: macro factors, a peek into Bitcoin’s exchange flows, DeFi’s standout performance and the latest news on what’s happening with the convergence of crypto and traditional capital markets. Let’s get started.&nbsp;\n\nMacro Developments\nThe latest US inflation data for May has given markets a reason to breathe easier. Headline CPI rose just 0.1% month-on-month, below the expected 0.2% while core CPI surprised even more, coming in at 0.1% versus the forecasted 0.3%. In short, inflation cooled more than expected. That’s good news for risk assets, as it takes some pressure off the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy.&nbsp;\nMarkets responded accordingly. The S&amp;P 500 ticked up by 20 basis points, while Bitcoin jumped 0.6%, briefly pushing past the $110K mark. The softer CPI print also boosted hopes of potential Fed rate cuts later in 2025, provided there are no major inflationary shocks in the future. That said, tariff-related risks, especially those tied to Trump-era trade policies, still loom large and could muddy the picture in future reports.&nbsp;\nFor crypto, lower inflation tends to be a tailwind. It supports assets like Bitcoin by reducing the likelihood of aggressive rate hikes. But while the CPI numbers are encouraging, broader policy uncertainties could still keep bullish momentum in check.&nbsp;\n\nBitcoin’s Exchange Flows\nA look at Bitcoin exchange flows over the past six months reveals a clear and compelling trend: when Bitcoin moves off exchanges, prices tend to rise. The data shows a strong negative correlation of –0.6052 between net exchange flows and price suggesting that sustained outflows are often followed by upward price momentum.&nbsp;\nOver the past 30 days, daily outflows averaged over 72K BTC, while Bitcoin climbed 4.4%. This pattern reinforces the idea that steady withdrawals from exchanges can act as a bullish signal, hinting at investor confidence and reduced short-term selling pressure.&nbsp;\nFigure 1: Bitcoin’s net exchange flows&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSource: AMINA Bank, Glassnode (12 June 2025)&nbsp;\nThe scatter plot below captures this relationship visually, plotting daily net exchange flows against Bitcoin prices. The dashed trendline (an ordinary least squares regression) shows the average expected price based on flow activity. Its downward slope confirms the inverse relationship: larger outflows typically align with higher prices, and inflows with lower ones.&nbsp;\nWhile exchange flows alone don’t explain every market move, they remain a valuable contrarian signal for anticipating Bitcoin price actionpa, rticularly when other market indicators are mixed.&nbsp;\nFigure 2:&nbsp; For Bitcoin, larger exchange outflows have coincided with higher prices and larger inflows with lower prices&nbsp;\n\nSource: AMINA Bank, Glassnode (12 June 2025)&nbsp;\n\nOptimism Surrounding DeFi\nDeFi tokens surged this week after encouraging signals from none other than the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In a roundtable hosted at the SEC’s Washington headquarters, Chair Paul Atkins hinted at the possibility of regulatory exemptions that could allow US-based DeFi firms to operate with fewer constraints. Markets responded swiftly. Blue-chip tokens UNI and AAVE each jumped 20% following the remarks.&nbsp;\nZooming out, the DeFi sector has been on a strong run over the past three months. Aave’s AAVE token is up an impressive 74%, while Uniswap’s UNI climbed 38%. Meanwhile, the total market capitalisation of leading DeFi tokens (AAVE, UNI, MKR, BAL, SNX, CRV, COMP and SUSHI) has swelled to $11.41 billion, marking a 25.4% increase in just 90 days.&nbsp;\nWith regulatory clarity finally starting to take shape and investor confidence rebounding, DeFi appears to be regaining its edge in the broader crypto landscape.&nbsp;\nFigure 3: DeFi has been a standout sector over the past three months.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSource: AMINA Bank, Glassnode (12 June 2025)&nbsp;\nProminent industry voices including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, Uniswap’s Hayden Adams, and Aptos CEO Avery Ching have welcomed the SEC’s recent efforts to foster a more supportive environment for DeFi innovation in the US. The DeFi roundtable, hosted by the SEC, has sparked cautious optimism across the crypto space. While the tone has clearly shifted towards dialogue and flexibility, particularly with the prospect of an innovation exemption on the table, the industry is still in a wait-and-see mode. All eyes are now on the SEC’s next move, with hopes pinned on clearer, more consistent regulation that can support long-term growth without stifling experimentation.&nbsp;\n\nCapital Market Convergence\nThe past week has marked a turning point in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the crypto industry. Circle’s blockbuster NYSE debut on 5 June 2025 raised $1.1 billion at $31 per share, with the stock soaring 168% on day one. This was a clear sign of institutional appetite for compliant, crypto-native infrastructure. Just days earlier, on 2 June, Robinhood completed its $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, gaining access to over 50 regulatory licences and positioning itself to serve both retail and institutional crypto clients globally. And on 11 June, Stripe deepened its crypto presence by acquiring wallet provider Privy, a move that strengthens its ability to offer seamless blockchain integration across mainstream applications.&nbsp;\nThese are not isolated moves, they’re the latest in a multi-year trend that began with bold corporate bets on Bitcoin. From MicroStrategy’s headline-grabbing BTC strategy back in August 2020 to the growing embrace of digital assets by asset managers, banks and now web2 giants, crypto is steadily evolving from a speculative frontier to foundational financial infrastructure.&nbsp;\nThis convergence is a reflection of two key forces: increasing regulatory clarity and growing institutional recognition of crypto’s role in the future of finance. What’s emerging is a more efficient, transparent and globally connected system – one that’s starting to look less like an alternative, and more like the future of financial markets.&nbsp;\n\nConclusion\nBitcoin and Ethereum’s recent rallies, buoyed by encouraging inflation data and positive exchange flows, coincide with a broader resurgence in DeFi amid improving regulatory clarity, all pointing to a market coming of age. Regulatory greenlights like Dubai’s approval of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin are accelerating adoption, and major capital market moves such as Circle’s blockbuster IPO, Robinhood’s Bitstamp acquisition and Stripe’s partnership with Privy underscore the convergence of old and new finance.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nLooking ahead, all eyes are on the macro stage: from the US FOMC meeting next week on 17-18 June, to the Trump administration’s looming tariff policy deadline. Yet the common thread in all these developments is unmistakable: crypto is cementing itself as an integral part of global financial infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nDisclaimer – Research&nbsp;\nThis document has been prepared by AMINA Bank AG (“AMINA”) in Switzerland.

Multiple factors, including fears over a looming U.S. economic recession and changing regulations, have contributed to a volatile period for cryptocurrency.\n\nThese rapid shifts mean businesses that interact with digital assets must stay updated on shifting regulatory frameworks and maintain a deep understanding of the evolving risks and benefits the industry presents.\n\nProposed Repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121\n\nThe proposed repeal of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) seems to be an important regulatory change that could affect the crypto market. This change might indicate a shift in how organizations that safeguard crypto assets should account for these holdings.\n\nOriginally issued in March of 2022, SAB 121 required firms to report the fair value of crypto assets as liabilities, even when the entity did not control the asset. Many finance managers and crypto custodians found these requirements misaligned with the unique characteristics of the industry and to potentially inflate perceived risk. The issuance of SAB 122 on January 23, 2025, intends to completely repeal the SAB 121 customer asset reporting requirement which alters the requirements and reporting disclosures for changes in accounting principles for entities.\n\nSAB 122 intends to benefit the crypto industry, as it reduces the complexity of digital asset accounting for SEC-reporting companies and makes it easier for banks to offer digital asset custody services.\n\nReal Estate Tokenization and Real-World Asset Integration\n\nA noteworthy development in asset digitization is the tokenization of real estate within the crypto ecosystem. Real-world assets (RWAs) are increasingly being tokenized and sold to investors, blending traditional investment models with digital frameworks.\n\nFor example, the Real Estate Metaverse (REM) is a blockchain platform that offers fractional ownership of property, for as low as $100 in some instances. Buyers receive passive income from real estate investments that are proportional to their holdings.\n\nBy leveraging blockchain technology, tokenized real estate offers enhanced liquidity and fractional ownership opportunities, presenting a transformative opportunity for investment firms and developers.\n\nRegulatory Scrutiny and Corporate Adoption\n\nThe evolving regulatory landscape has become a defining factor in the crypto market's trajectory. Regulatory agencies worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing crypto firms, ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks and investor protection standards. Simultaneously, businesses are responding to these changes by adjusting their accounting practices.\n\nThe adoption of new accounting standards plays a pivotal role in this transition. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recently introduced changes under ASC 350-60, requires businesses to measure and report certain digital assets at fair value which significantly improves transparency and enables clearer disclosure of gains and losses via net income.\n\nSubscribe and stay on top of it all.\n\nJoin our mailing list and be the first to receive alerts, newsletters and webinar invitations by email.\n\nSubscribe\n\nLooking Ahead: Trends and Considerations for Business Leaders\n\nIn an ever-evolving industry, accurate forecasting can prove particularly challenging. However, we can expect certain cryptocurrency market trends to unfold this year, including the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), selective venture capital funding and stricter regulations of crypto exchanges.\n\nArtificial Intelligence in Crypto\n\nAI tokens, or cryptocurrencies directly related to an AI venture, are beginning to flood the space and have surpassed $39 billion in value. This convergence promises new value and enhanced automation to businesses across a variety of industries.\n\nAdditionally, utilizing AI to make crypto trades has become increasingly popular as automation continues to revolutionize the finance industry.\n\nStable Funding and GENIUS Act\n\nAfter crypto’s decline in 2022, funding has stabilized as investors gain renewed confidence in the industry, evidenced by a $485 million venture capital (VC) funding in blockchain startups. Although crypto VC deals fell from last year’s first to fourth quarter, funding rebounded in Q4. Investors are growing more selective, with capital flowing to a smaller number of stronger products.\n\nEven if the market hits a recession, the industry could still see large investments or acquisitions as VCs need to deploy capital regardless of macroeconomic trends. An economic slowdown would likely continue the trend of VC selectivity or shift focus to more resilient sectors like healthcare.\n\nThe proposed GENIUS Act (Generating Equity for National Economic Support to Increase Stability) is proposed federal legislation establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for pegged stablecoins issued by federal regulated entities. This legislation marks a significant step toward formalizing regulatory oversight of stablecoin issuers who will be expected to maintain 1:1 reserve backing, submit to independent audits, and provide transparent, verifiable proof-of-reserve reporting. These requirements echo the standards long established in traditional financial reporting and assurance, signaling a clear convergence between digital assets and regulated and traditional finance.\n\nAs regulatory clarity emerges, issuers will need to adopt institutional-grade controls, governance structures and compliance practices. Forward-looking firms that invest now in building audit-ready infrastructure and financial transparency will be best positioned to lead in a maturing market where trust, not just technology, is the differentiator. This Act marks a major step toward mainstream adoption and federal recognition of stablecoins, while demanding the same level of transparency and safety expected of traditional financial institutions.\n\nStrategic Reserves\n\nIn Q1 the President signed an executive order to create the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, positioning bitcoin as a national reserve asset, aiming to solidify the US’s leadership in digital assets. Alongside bitcoin, the administration announced plan for a broader stockpile encompassing cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Ripple further underscoring the government’s commitment to embracing a diverse range of digital assets.\n\nThe impact of the US government’s endorsement is expected to enhance the legitimacy of these tokens, further encouraging institutional investors to engage more confidently with digital assets. These initiatives are posed to significantly impact the adoption and integration of digital assets into both national and potential global financial systems.\n\nRamped Up Regulations\n\nSEC Chair Paul Atkins created the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU) to develop clear guidelines for crypto token registration and disclosure. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) has also enhanced its oversight to better regulate the market with the launch of its digital asset markets pilot program, which covers tokenized non-cash collateral. These efforts mark a period of a more proactive regulatory approach, rather than relying on enforcement actions to retroactively define policies.\n\nStrategies for Business Leaders\n\nAs the cryptocurrency landscape continues to shift, business leaders should remain proactive in adapting to crypto market trends. Key strategic actions include:\n\nMonitoring regulatory changes and ensuring compliance with emerging standards\n\nExploring innovative opportunities in DeFi and tokenized assets\n\nEmbracing accounting practices that prioritize transparency in crypto asset reporting\n\nBy staying informed and adopting robust strategies, business leaders can navigate the ebbs and flows of the cryptocurrency market while seizing growth opportunities in this rapidly evolving space.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nDespite fluctuating markets and the decline in bitcoin value, areas of growth remain in the cryptocurrency industry, decentralized finance and RWA tokenization.\n\nRegulatory frameworks continue to shift as the industry evolves and organizations must be aware of reporting and disclosure requirements when safeguarding digital assets.\n\nThe proposed issuance of SAB 122 has intended to be beneficial to the industry and organizations looking to offer digital asset custody services.\n\nFears of a looming recession could impact sizable crypto investments, as VCs grow more selective.\n\nStaying informed on market changes and adhering to industry-specific accounting practices can help businesses succeed in a rapidly shifting environment.\n\nYour Guide Forward\n\nCherry Bekaert’s Accounting Advisory practice can assist you with complex reporting regulations and transactions to ensure regulatory compliance.

  "report": "## Sui's Strategic Vision and Alignment with Market Narratives: A Detailed Review\n\nThis section provides a detailed review of Sui's strategic vision, drawing from its whitepaper, official communications, and alignment with current market narratives. The analysis encompasses Sui's architecture, tokenomics, ecosystem development, and future growth vectors.\n\n### 1. Core Philosophy and Architecture\n\nSui distinguishes itself by integrating scalability, safety, usability, and composability into a unified design, rather than focusing on a single feature. This comprehensive approach aims to address the fundamental limitations that have constrained blockchain adoption. Sui's architecture is built upon three core elements:\n\n*   **Move Programming Language:** Sui utilizes the Move programming language, initially developed by Facebook for the Libra (later Diem) project. Move is designed to provide a safe and flexible environment for writing smart contracts, emphasizing resource-oriented programming and formal verification. This focus on security aims to prevent common vulnerabilities and reduce the attack surface.\n*   **Parallel Transaction Execution:** Unlike traditional blockchains that process transactions sequentially, Sui employs parallel transaction execution. This allows independent transactions to be processed simultaneously, significantly increasing throughput and reducing confirmation times.\n*   **DAG-Based Consensus (Mysticeti):** Sui utilizes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based consensus mechanism called Mysticeti. This leaderless graph structure aims for ultra-fast finality and reduced latency. The Mysticeti consensus upgrade has enabled finality times of approximately 400ms.\n\nThese architectural choices are complemented by innovations such as MEV resistance, DeepBook (a built-in Central Limit Order Book), sponsored transactions, advanced scalability, and Kiosk (a decentralized commerce primitive).\n\n### 2. Tokenomics and Community Engagement\n\nSui's tokenomics are built around a fixed maximum supply of 10 billion SUI tokens. The token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem, including staking, gas fee payments, governance, and facilitating transactions within dApps.\n\nSui has deliberately avoided traditional airdrops, opting for more selective mechanisms to attract a community of genuinely interested participants. The token allocation is structured to ensure long-term alignment and broad distribution over time.\n\nCommunity engagement extends beyond tokenomics to include educational initiatives, developer support programs, and regional growth strategies. The Sui Foundation's grant program and the Sui Global Accelerator Program aim to catalyze ecosystem development.\n\n### 3. Ecosystem Development and Use Cases\n\nSui's architecture is designed to empower projects and protocols to build novel solutions. Innovative dApps and infrastructure solutions are recognizing Sui's architectural advantages and building experiences made possible only by its unique design.\n\nSui's high performance and security make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including:\n\n*   **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Sui's efficiency is ideal for DeFi applications that require high throughput and low latency. Use cases include decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending and borrowing platforms, and stablecoins.\n*   **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Digital Art:** Sui's object-centric model is perfect for handling unique asset management and high volumes of transactions.\n*   **Gaming and Virtual Worlds:** Sui's architecture supports fast, low-latency transactions for in-game asset trades and secure ownership of digital items.\n*   **Supply Chain and Provenance:** Sui's object model can record the lifecycle of assets, providing transparent supply chains and verification mechanisms.\n*   **Enterprise Applications:** Sui's robustness makes it suitable for enterprise solutions requiring data integrity, auditability, and interoperability.\n\n### 4. User Experience Innovations\n\nSui aims to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 user experiences through protocol-level innovations. These include:\n\n*   **zkLogin:** This primitive allows users to access Sui applications using familiar Web2 logins while preserving self-custody principles.\n*   **Sponsored Transactions:** Applications can cover transaction costs on behalf of their users, removing the need for new users to acquire tokens for gas fees.\n*   **Sui Name Service (SNS):** SNS allows users and applications to create subdomains, fostering an intuitive organizational structure.\n\n### 5. Leadership and Institutional Backing\n\nSui Network's team comprises former Meta engineers with expertise in blockchain and programming language design. The project has attracted substantial institutional investment across multiple rounds.\n\nInstitutional adoption represents a critical validation signal for blockchain technology. Sui's rapid institutional engagement across multiple sectors provides evidence of its long-term potential.\n\n### 6. Competitive Landscape\n\nSui primarily competes with Aptos and Solana. Sui's Mysticeti consensus outperforms Aptos and Solana in finality times. Sui has embraced horizontal scaling, while Solana prioritizes vertical scaling.\n\nFrom an ecosystem development perspective, the relationship between Sui, Aptos, and Solana demonstrates patterns of competition and collaboration.\n\n### 7. Future Growth Vectors\n\nKey areas of future development for Sui include:\n\n*   Enhanced developer tools\n*   Expanded ecosystem\n*   Cross-chain integration\n*   Research and innovation\n\nSui's comprehensive approach to blockchain infrastructure creates multiple paths for continued growth and adoption.\n\n### 8. Alignment with Market Narratives\n\nSui's strategic vision aligns with several current market narratives:\n\n*   **Scalability and Performance:** Sui's architecture addresses the need for scalable and high-performance blockchain solutions.\n*   **Developer Experience:** Sui's developer-first approach caters to the growing demand for developer-friendly platforms.\n*   **User Experience:** Sui's focus on user experience aligns with the need for intuitive and seamless Web3 applications.\n*   **Institutional Adoption:** Sui's institutional backing and partnerships reflect the increasing interest from traditional finance in blockchain technology.\n*   **Real-World Asset Tokenization:** Sui's architecture is well-suited for representing real-world assets on-chain, aligning with the growing trend of RWA tokenization.\n*   **AI Integration:** Sui's vision for the platform as a coordination layer for AI agents aligns with the emerging convergence of AI and blockchain.\n\n### 9. Challenges and Considerations\n\nDespite its advantages, Sui faces challenges including:\n\n*   Adoption and network effects\n*   Interoperability\n*   Regulatory environment\n*   Scalability under load\n*   Security risks\n\n### 10. Conclusion\n\nSui's strategic vision is to create a comprehensive blockchain platform that addresses the limitations of earlier systems and enables a wide range of applications. Its focus on scalability, security, usability, and composability, combined with its developer-first approach and institutional backing, positions it as a strong contender in the blockchain landscape. By aligning with current market narratives and addressing key challenges, Sui aims to achieve mainstream adoption and drive the next wave of blockchain innovation.\n"
